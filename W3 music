Project Name:  (W3 music)
- **Team Name:  (W3 music )

- **[level : 1


## Project Overview :
W3 music is a market place that would serve as a means of income for small scale music creatives ( producers & songwriters). A stop shop for players in the music field for all your music needs. ( beats, lyrics, and so on.) As an artist, I can get all I need to make my music,from the comfort my home . 
With W3music dapp, songwriters and beat makers can mint their works on chain and make it available for sale.
For so many decades in the music industry, songwriters don’t usually get enough recognition and credit for their works,We are going to change that with copyright through Nfts, and mintbase powering the smart contracts.





- - (W3 music) : A stop shop for all players in the music fields.

- A Brief Over view of W3 music : 



Take a little time to visualize this for a second, I will use a songwriter as an example
Imagine me as a songwriter, I have a lot of composed songs in my library, but I don't know who is going to buy this songs, because the musicians in my vicinity don't feel the need to employ a songwriter,which is quite discouraging for me.
All I have to do is make a recording of the songs I want to sell, not necessarily a standard recording, W3 music dapp will make it easy for artist to upload various qualities of the recording.
I could make this recording with my phone and post it on W3 music dapp, with a lot of musicians looking for songs to buy I would be making income from writing songs at the comfort of my house, I don’t even have to be a professional songwriter to sell songs, anyone with a brief song idea can record with his phone and put it up for sale.
while also getting credit for writing this songs as transactions will be powered by mintbase and recorded on Blockchain.
On the other hand the artist that buys the song can have access to singing, performing the song, he also gets real value for what he is buying. ( steady income for me as a songwriter, real value for the buyer).
This illustration also applies to a producer/ beatmaker, that posts his beat for sale.


Project Details


### Project Details



We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):



components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
W3 is a stop shop for all music players, unlike other  music dapp we are not a music streaming platform.




### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

W3 dapp
problem/ problem area that the project is addressing

*Lack of exposure for independent artist
*Insufficient Compensation
* Difficulty In sourcing music services
*low sales of NFt transactions in music dapps built on near blockchain
*lack of African diversity in Web3 space

Problem of low sales and transactions in Music Dapps built on the near Blockchain
Most music dapp built on the near blockchain don't really get enough transactions and usage, this is because a lot of creatives most especially in Africa are not yet in tuned with the idea of music NfTs and music streaming on web3.
To attract Web2 creatives to the web 3 space. we have to give them something that can solve their immediate problem. which is basically income. W3 music dapp is going to be the game changer in Web3 music, by creating a Dapp that helps creatives make money easily, this will organically attract them to the near ecosystem, as they will be getting real value for their craft and also spending more time on the dapp. 


- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our target audience are music creatives and all players in the music field
Creatives that are looking to connect to a wider audience and make income from their craft .


- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
W3 music is the first of its kind in the near ecosystem.
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
There are no music dapp in other ecosystem that offers the same or similar value as w3 music, (none that I know of). W3 music will be the first of its kind.

## Future Plans
Our vision is to get 5000 active users in 12 months, I currently reside in lagos nigeria, the  creative hub of Africa, We will integrate a business plan that allows producers and songwriters users to get rewarded for every transaction made on the dapp. 

We will host a fund raising campaign for investors to support producers and songwriters on the dapp, funds raised will be used to brand and promote the artiste( shooting a standard video , promoting their songs , buying some equipment for producers that cannot afford). Basically funds will be used to support music creatives on the dapp

We will have an extension of the dapp, where premium users can chat and interact with each other.

Aside from selling beats and songs , We will also have a segment where other players in the music field like instrumentalists, graphic designers, videographers can create a profile with their works and get jobs from people who will be in need of their services, something like a linkdin for musicians

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Mintbase Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.

I have been following mintbase for a while, I heard about the grant on twitter.


Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

We initially submitted a grant request to Sankore ( regional hub in Kenya) in September, we were about receiving the grant, but unfortunately we got an email from their team on Tuesday saying grants channels has been closed due to some internal structuring,so we decided to write to mintbase grant program for support.
