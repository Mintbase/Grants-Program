## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary). 
  - Carbify is an all-inclusive platform empowering individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint through CO2 tokens, NFTrees, and a gaming experience, while supporting local communities and promoting environmental awareness.

- A brief description of your project.
  - "Carbify is a disruptive alternative for the current carbon market offsetting solutions and methodologies. 90% of the current CO2 offsetting is done illegally and based on wrong data / intentions. We are using blockchain technology to create a transparent and immutable way to document CO2 compensation. This is based on our own very strict rule sets created by a team of ecologists. To accomplish our goals we created an ecosystem with features like:

  - We plant trees and increase biodiversity in the Amazon rainforest. 
  - We offer high yield ‘ReFi’ solutions without inflation.
  - We are a game producer. Our first game is a web3 MMO-RTS game.
  - We initiated the world's first certified carbon debits on chain.
  - Our ‘Global Carbon Standard’ is the new standard for carbon standards and methodologies. Certified by the United Nations (UNFCCC). Disruptive for the ‘current elite’. We offer a solid alternative that actually works.
  - Our tree planting projects offer food security, fight poverty and increase social impact for (poor) communities. Meanwhile the trees absorb CO2 from the air and generate $aCO2 tokens.
  - We offer educational programs for schools and universities.
  - We offer an API data feed for businesses to proof offsets and carbon administration."
  
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.
  - As Eco Empires is an integral part of our solution, we offer games that incorporate a sustainable component while remaining enjoyable and exciting to play. With Mintbase's support, we can raise awareness for our project while emphasizing our games. Furthermore, we will benefit from reliable blockchain solutions provided by Mintbase, enabling us to develop our dApps and mint NFTs. Given the multichain nature of our project, our goal is to engage as many participants as possible, primarily targeting the most robust blockchains.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
-   Carbify is an exciting project because it addresses important environmental and social issues while also leveraging innovative blockchain technology to create a more transparent and secure carbon credit trading platform.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

- Carbify wants to be as flexible as possible. We support this planet by ecological blockchain based solutions and we want to be able to support as many ecosystems, dApps and projects as possible. Axelar could help us out in a major way here. However, before we start investing in the architecture, documentation, mockups etc we need to learn more and discuss with experts.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - We will introduce a completely new and disruptive technology to the Mintbase blockchain, enabling Mintbase to claim full carbon neutrality. This is already an essential requirement for most major companies in Europe, and it will soon become crucial worldwide. The significant energy consumption in the blockchain industry is a growing concern, and our innovation has the potential to transform the Mintbase blockchain.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - 1. Individuals: Carbify's NFTrees and aCO2 tokens provide an innovative and engaging way for individuals to offset their carbon footprint. This can appeal to environmentally conscious consumers who want to make a real impact on the environment while also earning a tangible reward.

  2. Businesses: Many businesses are committed to sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint. Carbify's carbon offsetting platform can be a valuable tool for businesses to offset their emissions and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability to their customers and stakeholders.

  3. Organizations: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government agencies, and other organizations that are committed to addressing climate change can benefit from Carbify's carbon offsetting projects. By supporting Carbify's reforestation and afforestation projects, these organizations can demonstrate their commitment to mitigating climate change and reducing the effects of deforestation.

  Overall, Carbify's target audience is anyone who is concerned about climate change and wants to take action to reduce their carbon footprint.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
  - Carbify is a platform that helps individuals and organizations reduce their carbon footprint and make a positive impact on the environment. The company compensates for carbon emissions through the use of high-quality CO2 tokens and certification processes, and also offers NFTrees that represent real trees that absorb CO2 from the air. Participants can earn $aCO2 tokens, which are certified carbon debit tokens tied to the Amazon rainforest, and use them to offset their carbon footprint.

  Carbify is committed to educating and supporting local communities, and has already planted over 10,000 trees, acquired over 2,300 hectares of forest land, and has a membership of over 100,000 people worldwide. The company has also developed a massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game called Eco Empires: Battle for the Earth, which promotes environmental awareness and sustainability.

  Overall, Carbify is a comprehensive platform that provides individuals and organizations with the tools they need to reduce their carbon footprint and make a positive impact on the environment. Through compensation, education, and community support, Carbify is leading the way towards a more sustainable future.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
  - 1. CarbonX: CarbonX is a blockchain-based platform that enables individuals and businesses to offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits. CarbonX also offers a mobile app that tracks users' carbon footprint and provides tips on how to reduce it.

2. ClimateTrade: ClimateTrade is a blockchain-based platform that offers carbon offsetting solutions for individuals and businesses. The platform enables users to purchase carbon credits and track their carbon emissions. ClimateTrade also offers a marketplace for sustainable products and services.

3. Poseidon: Poseidon is a blockchain-based platform that enables individuals and businesses to offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits. The platform uses a unique carbon credit called a ""Carbon Currency"" that is backed by real carbon credits.

4. Veridium: Veridium is a blockchain-based platform that enables companies to manage their carbon footprint through carbon offsetting and sustainability-focused initiatives. The platform uses blockchain technology to create a transparent and secure carbon credit trading platform."

While each of these projects focuses on carbon offsetting and reforestation, Carbify's use of NFTrees and gamification is a unique approach to engaging and incentivizing individuals to offset their carbon footprint and support reforestation efforts.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
