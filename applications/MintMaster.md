### Ecosystem Fit

**We have identified a problem:**
- Creating generative NFTs collections requires coding skills.
- Lack of management in existing NFT collections.

**The solution:**
- Our NFT management tool provides a CODE-FREE solution to create and manage NFTs on the NEAR protocol.


**Our target audience:**
- Game developers (new and existing).
- NFT collection creators.

**Our tool allows to create generative NFTs without the need for coding skills. It also eases the burden on experienced users due to the “Easy deploy” feature. The tool can also add or edit attributes in batches.**
