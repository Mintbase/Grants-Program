## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This project is in response to an RFP.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.

Despite the increasing awareness of the need to reduce carbon emissions, many companies, organizations, and individuals struggle to accurately track their carbon footprint. This lack of tracking and transparency makes it difficult to identify areas where they can reduce their carbon footprint and ultimately reach their environmental goals.

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.

Our proposed solution is to build a dApp on Mintbase using NEAR Protocol API, which will allow companies, organizations, and individuals to easily track their carbon footprint. The dApp will provide users with personalized recommendations for reducing their carbon footprint and options for carbon trading. This will help to increase transparency and accountability in tracking carbon emissions, and provide a simple and effective solution for individuals and organizations looking to reduce their environmental impact. By offering an accessible and user-friendly platform, we aim to empower more people to take action towards achieving the SDGs and mitigating climate change.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

This project aligns with our values and mission to create a positive impact on the environment. It further provides an opportunity to leverage blockchain technology to address one of the most pressing issues of our time - climate change. As the world becomes more environmentally conscious, there is a growing demand for sustainable solutions, and our team recognizes the opportunity to create a valuable product that can help meet this demand.

### Project Details

**Deliverables

A functional dApp: The primary deliverable of the project will be a fully functional dApp that allows users to track their carbon footprint, receive recommendations on how to reduce it, and engage in carbon trading. The dApp will be built on the NEAR Protocol, using smart contracts to securely and transparently manage carbon emissions data and transactions.

User interface design: In order to ensure a seamless user experience, the project will include the design and development of a user interface for the dApp. This will include wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes that allow users to easily navigate and interact with the dApp.

Carbon emissions tracking and reporting system: The dApp will include a tracking and reporting system that allows users to accurately measure and report their carbon emissions. This system will include data sources and APIs to integrate with existing tracking systems, as well as algorithms to calculate emissions based on user inputs.

Carbon trading platform: The dApp will include a carbon trading platform that allows users to buy and sell carbon credits, and engage in other carbon trading activities. The platform will be integrated with the NEAR Protocol, and will include smart contracts and other features to ensure secure and transparent transactions.

Analytics and reporting: The project will include the development of analytics and reporting tools that allow users to track their progress in reducing their carbon footprint, and provide insights into broader trends and patterns in carbon emissions data. These tools will be built using data visualization and analytics tools, and will be accessible through the dApp user interface.

Testing and deployment: The final deliverable of the project will be a fully tested and deployed dApp that is ready for use by companies, organizations, and individuals. In collaboration with the Mintbase team, we will conduct rigorous testing and quality assurance procedures to ensure that the dApp is stable, secure, and reliable, and will work closely with users to gather feedback and improve the user experience.

**Benefits to Mintabse and NEAR Protocol

The dApp will help to increase the visibility and adoption of Mintbase as a platform for creating and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By providing a practical and valuable use case for NFTs in tracking carbon emissions, Mintbase can demonstrate the versatility and potential of its platform.

The project has the potential to attract a new user base interested in sustainable practices, which could increase the number of users on the Mintbase platform. This could also potentially lead to increased usage of other features and functionalities on the Mintbase platform.

The project will provide new revenue streams for Mintbase, as users engage in carbon trading on the platform. This will potentially lead to increased demand for the NEAR token, and overall growth of the NEAR ecosystem. 

The project will help increase exposure and awareness of Mintbase and NEAR Protocol in the sustainability and climate action communities. This will lead to increased partnerships and collaborations with other organizations and initiatives in this space, further expanding the reach and impact of the Mintbase platform.

**Limitations**

Regulatory compliance: Carbon trading is a highly regulated industry, and there are a number of legal and regulatory requirements that must be followed. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in legal liabilities, fines, or reputational damage.

Integration with Existing Systems: Many companies and organizations have existing systems and processes for tracking carbon emissions, and there is a risk that the dApp may not be compatible with these systems. As a team, we will carefully consider integration and interoperability with existing systems in order to maximize the value of the dApp for users.

Funding and resources: Building a successful dApp such as this one requires significant funding and resources, including technical expertise, marketing, and community building. Our team already meets this threshold, howeverd, when scaling, we may need to outsource more expertise.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

This project is designed to be built on the NEAR Protocol blockchain, and as such, it is fully integrated into the NEAR ecosystem. By leveraging the NEAR blockchain, the project will benefit from its fast and secure transaction processing, as well as its developer-friendly features such as smart contracts and easy deployment of decentralized applications.

The project's integration with NEAR means that it can leverage Mintbase's NFT marketplace to create and trade carbon credits or other digital assets related to carbon emissions. This can potentially provide new revenue streams for the project and enable users to exchange carbon credits in a transparent and secure manner.
