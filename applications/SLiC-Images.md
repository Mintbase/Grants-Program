# **Mintbase Grant Proposal**

Project Name: SLiC Images
Team Name: SLiC
Payment Address: slicimages.near 
[Level](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/blob/main/README.md#level_slider-levels): 3

## **Project Overview** ðŸ“„

SLiC Images a decentralized library of images, video, audio, vector graphics, and illustrations available through NFT Licensing.


### **Overview**

SLiC Images is building a library of decentralized media on the blockchain. We see that many photographers and videographers need to be paid for their content fairly; in retrospect, we are proposing a new approach by allowing media professionals to license their work through NFTs for commercial or personal use by others. We are focusing on normalizing the monetization for independent media makers through a new revenue model, NFT Licensing. The license is distributed and verifiable on-chain through a peer-to-peer consensus on Near. Mintbase will power the on-chain transactions and NFT smart contracts to help us drive adoption for NFT Licensing with photographers and videographers. Indie media professionals are constantly seeking new ways to generate revenue whether from freelancing or remote work. SLiC Images empowers this category of independent media by enabling them to become NFT Creators with the help of Mintbase and Near. 
The vision of SLiC Images is to allow any independent photographer or videographer to build a library of media assets that the general public can license. This helps archive the work of indie creators and build visibility for their work while helping to monetize it. We see the future of media sharing as a peer-to-peer approach allowing creators to give token-gated access through web3 technology. SLiC Images is evolving the utilization of blockchain by becoming a media-sharing marketplace. Our marketplace is a two-sided experience for general users and asset publishers. A general user is anyone seeking to license an image or video from an asset publisher. The general user can mint each license as NFT on the Near blockchain and have granted access to the media asset for a specified time. The other user is an asset publisher, which refers to anyone turning their media assets into stock images or videos available for licensing. The asset publisher can upload their media assets to a decentralized storage provider and use the blockchain to license their media assets. The NFT Licenses issued from the Asset Publisher are verifiable through DID(Decentralized Identifier).
SLiC Images will have an open-source software development kit for Licensing and Reporting of NFT base assets powered by Mintbase and Near for developer-friendly scaffolding tools to make it straightforward to implement via SLiC Images Open API.   


### **Project Details**
SLiC Images is an end-to-end NFT Licensing platform with an OPEN API specification. As a peer-to-peer marketplace, SLiC Images transforms media assets into on-chain NFT Licenses powered by Mintbase on the Near Protocol. The marketplace is a web-based implementation for content creators and users to transact, allowing each media asset to be licensed to be used one or more times by a set amount of users for a specific timeframe. The Open Source SDK allows developers to build or integrate the SLiC Images API, which interacts with the blockchain and oracles as NFT Licensing Automation & Reporting tool to simplify the steps in the process. Any developer can build and use the NFT Licensing of SLiC Images through the SDK, API, or the marketplace.

### **Ecosystem Fit**
We realize the challenges of web3 adoption for broad use cases, which is why we are hyper-focused on delivering value to end users while developing tools that others can use. The media sharing dapps on Near are growing, yet we bring a specific and tangible blockchain use case that also helps to drive mass adoption for the utility of NFTs. Licensing is already done through centralized platforms such as shutter shock, Getty Images, and others. SLiC Images is a better alternative because we let end users control their pricing and open-sourcing the tooling to allow other developers to build with us. Instead of fractionalizing licensing fees through a subscription-based model, we let users set their rates and terms & conditions and only charge for the platform infrastructure through buyer-side fees. This allows us to create a platform for media images and videos creators with nearly zero fees. SLiC Images delivers a solid use case for Mintbase with vertical media-sharing integration through a peer-to-peer marketplace for independent content creators.
