### Overview

**Become the blueprint for Near Protocol / Mintbase Spirits Marketplaces Business IRL**
PWX - Backed by Real Life
PWX is a platform that allows independent whisky distilleries to use blockchain to manage and distribute their future whisky casks.
PWX aims to improve the process of searching for and purchasing whisky casks by providing a more efficient and flexible marketplace for independent distilleries to sell their products directly to the final customer.
With PWX, independent distilleries have the freedom to scale their operations and have greater control over their production and distribution.


### Project Details

**B2C**
Customer Support Solutions
As an end customer, merging Digital Contract (Smart Contract) and Physical Contract ensure authenticity, ownership and assured by law – via Docusign connection. Logistics, storage/warehousing, and insurance of your cask are included.

**B2B**
Distillery Support Solutions
At PWX, we are committed to revolutionizing the whisky industry for independent distilleries. With our cutting-edge blockchain solution, we provide tailored support to help your distillery flourish.
Global Market Access:
Leverage the power of blockchain to access a global market. PWX’s blockchain-backed platform allows you to showcase your unique products to a worldwide audience of whisky enthusiasts.

**Customer Purchase Flow**

![alt text](https://pwxchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pwx_flow.png)

**Assigned Cask Value:** Each cask is assigned a value, and the NFT serves as the means of payment.

**Issuance of Purchase Order:** Upon NFT purchase, PWX generates a purchase order for cask production, initiating the production process.

**Purchase Contract with Distillery:** PWX enters into a purchase contract with the distillery, specifying the terms and conditions.

**Sales Contract with End Customer:** After the purchase contract, PWX establishes a sales contract with the end customer, ensuring a smooth transition from production to sale.

**Storage Contracts:** Simultaneously, PWX creates storage contracts between itself and the distillery, and another with the end customer.

**Payment Structure:** Payments are initiated, including the cask value, maintenance fees, Mintbase fees, and production costs.

**Calculate Net Sale Value:** Deduct production costs, Mintbase fees, and maintenance fees to determine the net sale value.

**Revenue Distribution:** Distribute revenue to entities as per the agreed percentages.

**Operational Maintenance:** Allocate x% of the revenue value for recurring revenue to support ongoing operational maintenance.

**Secure Contract Execution:** Ensure the security and legality of all contracts by conducting them exclusively through DocuSign.


### Ecosystem Fit

Where and how does PWX fit into the ecosystem IRL to become the blueprint for Near Protocol / Mintbase Spirits Marketplaces Business IRL

This approach ensures a seamless and transparent user experience, benefiting both consumers and independent distilleries in the whisky industry. PWX - Backed by Real Life is poised to redefine the landscape of whisky cask transactions and enhance the overall industry ecosystem through its innovative solutions and collaborative framework.

**Membership and Community**
**Membership Benefits:** Advantages of joining PWX – Backed by Real Life, including access to an independent distillery community.
**Forum and Community Section:** Space for distilleries to discuss industry topics, share experiences, and seek advice.
**Event Calendar:** List upcoming whisky events, tastings, and festivals.
**Distillery Showcases:** Opportunities for independent distilleries to participate and present their products at these events.

**Immutable Records:**
The blockchain records are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered or tampered with. Protects your distillery’s reputation and ensures the integrity of your brand.

**Customer Engagement:**
Blockchain also allows us to create engaging experiences for your customers. They can trace the journey of each bottle, and access information about the distillery, its history, and tasting notes with a simple scan of a QR code.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
PWX fosters collaborations within its blockchain ecosystem. Partner with other distilleries, distributors, or retailers in our network to create special editions and exclusive releases.

Number	Deliverable	Specification
1.	PWX Marketplace	first version of the PWX, including the foundational components of the PWX marketplace, built with Mintbase tools, adapting the UI/UX to our intended experience and defining the default settings for minting on the PWX. Ideally, the first code release will also include a simple minter that allows batch generation of an NFT series associated with a whisky cask. Brand Identity and website will also be included in this process, as well as setting up a test store as the gateway into a blender’s portfolio and determining how to set up whisky on the PWX.
This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
