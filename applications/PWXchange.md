**Assigned Cask Value:** Each cask is assigned a value, and the NFT serves as the means of payment.

**Issuance of Purchase Order:** Upon NFT purchase, PWX generates a purchase order for cask production, initiating the production process.

**Purchase Contract with Distillery:** PWX enters into a purchase contract with the distillery, specifying the terms and conditions.

**Sales Contract with End Customer:** After the purchase contract, PWX establishes a sales contract with the end customer, ensuring a smooth transition from production to sale.

**Storage Contracts:** Simultaneously, PWX creates storage contracts between itself and the distillery, and another with the end customer.

**Payment Structure:** Payments are initiated, including the cask value, maintenance fees, Mintbase fees, and production costs.

**Calculate Net Sale Value:** Deduct production costs, Mintbase fees, and maintenance fees to determine the net sale value.

**Revenue Distribution:** Distribute revenue to entities as per the agreed percentages.

**Operational Maintenance:** Allocate x% of the revenue value for recurring revenue to support ongoing operational maintenance.

**Secure Contract Execution:** Ensure the security and legality of all contracts by conducting them exclusively through DocuSign.
