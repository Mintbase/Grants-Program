## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Create Streaming Royalty/Residual Payment Claims, Token Gated Streaming Access and Supporting IP + Streaming Royalty + Licensing Legal Doc open source modules for devs/projects/startups in the NEAR + Mintbase ecosystem. 

### Overview
* Ample is a NEAR Foundation/Horizon project building launchpad, distribution and streaming infrastructure for future creator economies, so we have an intimate understanding of the use case and architecture of these solutions.
* Our startup looks to integrate with ecosystem projects and the Mintbase marketplace directly. We want to create a max value add for our users and want to see our token offerings to be deployed to multiple marketplaces and content distributed to multiple streaming platforms.
* Our team sees an opportunity to help provide the ecosystem with tooling while building our platform in tandem; we have legal experience, media and entertainment IP domain expertise and devs who are building a variety of token and legal contract solutions already. We feel comfortable sharing our solutions with NEAR + Mintbase to help others with a faster dApp creation process since we would’ve loved to see these initially when we joined the ecosystem. Other devs having these specific tools also does not detract or disrupt our main business model, and we would like to contribute to the NEAR ecosystem’s well being since we are invested in the growth and awareness of the protocol. We also just align with giving back to the ecosystem that has believed in us consistently(Horizon, NF, Partners, Friends, Community, Etc). 

### Project Details
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components can be seen here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNKs9GIc=/?share_link_id=362713797809 
* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality; see Miro
* An overview of the technology stack to be used: NEAR/Rust sc standards(NEP171), Arweave, Livepeer, JS
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed:

- NEAR BOS: https://docs.near.org/bos/components

- NEAR NFTs: https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/NonFungibleToken/ AND https://docs.near.org/tutorials/nfts/series

- NEAR RUST SDK: https://docs.near.org/sdk/rust/introduction

- Livepeer: https://docs.livepeer.org/sdks/livepeer-react/getting-started AND https://docs.livepeer.org/developers/core-concepts/studio/webhooks

- Arweave: https://cookbook.arweave.dev/guides/posting-transactions/irys.html AND https://docs.irys.xyz/developer-docs/irys-sdk

- Vercel serverless functions: https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions

* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic(going live on mainnet next week): https://ample-stream-web-beta.vercel.app/ AND see below iterations in "Development Status" section.
* What your project is not or will not provide or implement - We will need to include legal disclaimers for the legal UI module. Our solutions are meant to be used in tandem with legal counsel, while greatly reducing the costs and time associated with templated document generator(via UI module), full stack implementation and smart contract build outs. The legal modules will be thorough and could be used, but legal work should have some legal counsel supervision.


### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:
* We’re focused on building real world token based IP, content, royalty/residual and legal solutions; we want to first integrate our solutions with other NEAR projects and Mintbase. 
* Who is your target audience? Our target audience as a dApp would be streamers, creators, brands, labels, studios, networks and channels. For these modules, our target users would be devs looking to deploy NFT solutions that have legal contracts associated with the offering and are looking for gated and percentage based payment claiming solutions.
* What need(s) does your project meet? Our solutions remove time and cost resources; devs and projects could use our solutions in tandem with an NFT minter to have legal contracts, claiming and gated function solutions.
* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem? Most projects have some similar functions such as Tamago with streaming and Metapool with Launchpad functionality, but we are really focused on bridging multi marketplace and streaming platform distribution, data aggregation, and functional payment/tokenized IP solutions vs creating a singular use platform. The project that is most similar would be Story Protocol.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* Total Estimated Duration: 2 months
* Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): 1.5 per month - Combination of Legal, Full Stack Dev, SC Dev, PM over 60 days

Devs will be able to program percentage of claimable streaming amounts, time of holding period and minimum hold time variables. Designed to work with an NEP 171 contract. NEAR SC/Rust + JS |  
| 2. | Mintbase module: Gated Streaming Access Module | Module 2: NFT gated streaming access module that will allow devs/users to upload a video through UI, then the playing function/paywall will be gated and unlocked by holding an NFT. NFT can have timing variables. Also designed to work with an NEP 171 contract. NEAR SC/Rust + Livepeer + JS  **NOTE - We could also modify this for file or any other paywall access** |  
| 3. | NEAR chain integration | Modules 1 & 2 will be delivered as components that any team or project can read through documentation, watch tutorials and easily implement. BOS + NEAR + Mintbase Integration. |  


### Milestone 2 Example — Legal Contract Generator Module for 3 Common Use Cases
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  1.5
- **Costs:** 27,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial explaining all modules. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article + Video | We will publish an article and video that shows how to implement and use both modules we are building below. |
| 1. | Mintbase module: Legal Contract Generator with UI | Module 3: UI generator module with multi-select functionality allowing devs/users to create template legal documents from form entries that auto-populate on Arweave(or any preferred storage solution) and have a reference link generated that can be plugged in to any NEP 171 contract. Three of the most common legal docs will be accessible: full IP ownership legal doc, DAO/Trust ownership legal doc creation and a Licensing legal doc. This will allow NFT collections and tokenized IP to have a backing legal contract quickly. NEAR SC/Rust + Arweave + JS  |  
| 2. | Module 3 will be delivered as a component that any team or project can read through documentation, watch tutorials and easily implement. Users will be advised to consult with a legal team member as well. A disclaimer will also be included ensuring teams know they should consult legal counsel for specific jurisdiction compliance. BOS + NEAR + Mintbase Integration. |  

...
## Future Plans

* In the short term, we plan to utilize our ecosystem partners, accelerator partners(Horizon), and creator communities to grow our brand and NEAR ecosystem awareness. We additionally will be marketing our contributions to NEAR + Mintbase upon approval and delivery of milestones as we believe this creates an opportunity for BD with Media & Entertainment partners at an enterprise level.
* Our long term vision aside from creating a profitable and sustainable platform/infrastructure is to continue NEAR ecosystem integrations and partnerships, bringing creators and established communities plus brands to our project and tying in cross chain back end distribution.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

How did you hear about the Grants Program? Mintbase Team(Paul and Sérgio)
Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already - I think we stated most everything previously, but based on the template prompt q’s, we have previously built IP + trust documents, spent countless hours and fees researching legal IP best practices and are launching our Alpha platform on mainnet over the next week or so. NEAR Foundation gave us an initial grant to build our platform and we are a part of the NEAR Horizon program.
