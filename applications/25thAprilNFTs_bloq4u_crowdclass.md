## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

#### NFTs for the 25th of April celebrations

This project aims to produce NFTs for the **official commemorations of the 50th anniversary of 25th of April (1974)**, in two different moments: its 49th and its 50th anniversary, held in 2023 and 2024, respectively. 

To be able to mass-disseminate our collections, allow for an easy onboarding from non-web3 natives, and not require future users the prerequisite to holding crypto or any web3 wallet, the **consortium Bloq4U-Crowdclass** was formed. We aim to create the necessary integrations that will allow for (1) a Fiat-to-mint store, (2) a Token-gated content app, and (3) a technical integration between Crowdclass and Mintbase Platforms. We will include these tech improvements and development in the white-label NFT platform that we will place at the Commission's display to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 25th of April. For 2023, the 49th  anniversary, we will dedicate ourselves to building and delivering (1) and (2). 

To develop such solutions, the Bloq4u & Crowdclass consortium is requiring Mintbase to provide a grant for all tech development and integrations to create, curate, and promote the NFT collections. Bloq4u, the 25A Commission, and a list of academic partners will guarantee the necessary historical curatorship. Crowdclass will ensure the technical developments.


### Project Details

Bloq4u & Crowdclass are working on a big project to deploy NFT-powered experiences in the official celebrations of the 25th of April, a major Portuguese national holiday. The organization will use a white-label Platform, powered by  Crowdclass and curated by Bloq4u, to distribute & sell digital collections and provide proof-of-attendance badges to several initiatives happening around the commemorations.

The solution we’re developing includes several architectural components that can be additional developments and practical applications of MintbaseJS. 

Therefore, we propose a project with Mintbase to develop two open-source applications using MintbaseJS. We will also integrate these applications into the Crowdclass Platform to be used as practical use cases for the celebrations on the 25th of April, with the curatorship of Bloq4u.

This is an excellent opportunity to open up NFTs & digital assets to a broader audience, including schools, students, professionals, and government officials. It’s also an excellent opportunity for bigger visibility for all the teams involved in the organization.

#### Phase 1: Develop Mintbase JS Applications
As a tech and SW provider, Crowdclass will build the following two open-source applications using MintbaseJS:

**1) Fiat-to-mint store** - We propose to develop a library to mint NFTs via MintabaseJS, with a set of attributes and characteristics created and defined by the seller, but the minting only triggers upon a confirmation of payment in fiat using Stripe or another payment processor. Once the external API confirms the payment, the minting process is initiated. The NFT will be minted through the MintbaseJS minter directly to a connected NEAR Wallet or sent to an identified NEAR wallet.

**2) Token-gated content** - We also want to develop a library to provide and display exclusive media content, where we gate access and viewership to holders of specific NFTs in the user wallet. Bloq4u will curate this library.

We must develop an admin interface to configure the conditions for gating and uploading the available content and then the validation system to check the eligibility of a connected wallet by holding the right NFTs.

After completing the development of the previous two applications, we will integrate them into the proprietary Crowdclass platform and work with Bloq4U to use them for the 25 April Celebrations.

#### Phase 2: Curatorship + practical application on 25th of April
In the specific context of the 25th of April Celebrations, the organization will then use all of these components together to create many digital experiences as mentioned above (distribute & sell digital curated art and moments, provide proof-of-attendance badges for specific side-events, organize treasure hunts, and then provide exclusive offers to NFT holders). These experiences and collections will be curated by Bloq4u, together with other partners, and will be the purpose of an additional grant application to Near Foundation.


### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**
  - By providing a Fiat-to-Mint for NFTs in the Near ecosystem (and MintBase) and creating Token-gated content, our project will fit plenty of projects currently in the ecosystem without such features. As such, future NFT and Metaverse platforms will benefit from such near features, increasing their number of users by allowing for as easy web2-to-web3 onboarding. 


**Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?**
  - The proposed project aims to integrate a series of proposals for commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 25th of April, a major holiday in Portugal that celebrates the end of fascism and the advent of democracy (1974). 
  - In this sense, our roadmap entails a use case (MVP) in 2023. We intend to launch an NFT collection to commemorate the 49th anniversary of the 25th of April’s Revolution by issuing a series of collections specially designed for the official commemorations in Parliament. This will mean that each Parliamentary Group will have its own NFT to access the hemicycle. Similarly, all state hierarchy, the audience, and the parliamentary staff will also have their own NFT, serving as tickets and memorabilia.
  - Later, for the 50th anniversary, we aim to prepare and launch several NFT collections. These collections will be placed in the core of the official commemorations and will have nationwide exposure.
  - Within the different collections, we can identify the following: NFT certificates for completion of secondary studies, Tickets to official exhibitions and events, Communication and involvement of brands and institutional support, and Tradable Collection for the 25th of April Association and veterans.
  - As such, if for our MVP, we intend to relate with the political and administrative elite during 2024, our aim is the population at large, offering them easy-to-use onboarding mechanics and contribution to Web3 adoption powered by NEAR. 
 

**What need(s) does your project meet?**
  - This project intends to narrow the gap of web3 onboarding by creating a series of new tools to be used within the Near Ecosystem in general and by MintBase in particular. In this sense, and after submitting our deliveries, both the needs of having the possibility to use Fiat onramp in the NEAR ecosystem (and on MintBase) and to have Token-gated content will be met. 
   
**- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?**
  - Not that we are aware of.

## Future Plans

#### As for Bloq4U: 
As a boutique consultancy company, it aims to create the necessary conditions for a wide use of Web3 products, and henceforth it aims to promote and deliver projects of (mass) adoption. Within this scope, we aim to promote easy-to-onboard solutions that use blockchain technology it its diversity and assure its non-tech, non-web3 native use. In this sense, Bloq4U will continue to bring together such consortiums and partnerships that will allow for (1) a wider financial and technical literacy of different stakeholders, (2) promotion and access to educational programs and projects, (3) mass adoption and Web2 to Web3 transfers, (4) development and propagation of utility-based Web3 projects, and (5) the study of the Web3 space and ecosystem with the aim to bring clarity and coherence to the crypto economy industry.

#### As for Crowdclass: 
We have a growing number of users in private beta and expect to grow considerably in 2023 when we launch publicly.

With the integration of these components on the Crowdclass platform, they will then be used regularly by our growing user base.

Additionally, we plan to continue to extend our platform, develop these applications further, and eventually use more elements of MintbaseJS in real-world applications and use cases and contribute to the ecosystem.

Our long-term vision is that Crowdclass becomes the leading out-of-the-box platform for any brand and creator that wants to build engagement or loyalty programs with their audience, using experiences involving digital collectibles and NFTs.


#### As for Bloq4U + Crowdclass Consortium:
The 25th of April celebrations in 2023 will be the first test run for applying NFTs in the event in smaller and more contained settings. But the main goal is to extend the implementation nationwide for 2024.

For this implementation, we expect to expand this entire experience and further implement a full-blown and white-labeled Mintbase marketplace for NFTs with broad nationwide exposure to allow NFTs minting, owning, trading and selling for thousands of people.
