### Overview

World of the Abyss (WOTA)
Cross-platform Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG).
WOTA is a free-to-play cross-platform hardcore Lineage-like MMORPG game with bulletproof Web3-mechanics, AI-powered UGC/NPCs and sustainable economy.
We created WOTA with the aim of reviving the cherished classics of MMORPGs, such as Lineage Interlude, WoW, Ultima Online, and others, offering players the opportunity to enjoy them on various platforms, including mobile and PC. In addition to these classic elements, we are  integrating cutting-edge Web3 mechanics, including play2own and a peer-to-peer NFT marketplace for trading and earning (own2earn) which will be built on Mintbase and NEAR technologies . 
To enhance the gaming experience, we will introduce ClanDAO for true democracy within the game, and NFTs that allow players to own and trade in-game assets like gear, loot boxes, pets, lands, and more. 
Furthermore, we're implementing AI-powered NPCs through a Quest system and user-generated content (UGC) to increase engagement and enjoyment for our players.
You can get more detailed information at this link: https://docsend.com/view/495e5ddp6vfnuuj9
We are going to integrate Mintbase for all Web3 mechanics in the game including building in-game P2P marketplace, in-game gear NFTs minting and trading, Mintbase wallet integration, interconnecting high-end in-game mechanics with Mintbase, etc. We already have a successful experience integrating NEAR wallet.

Players are encouraged to register a Mintbase wallet for several compelling reasons:
Access to High-End Content: Registering a Mintbase wallet unlocks access to premium content, powerful items, and various in-game advantages. This incentivizes players to create wallets, enhancing their overall gaming experience.
Security and Ownership: Possessing a Mintbase wallet guarantees secure ownership of in-game assets, such as NFTs and virtual currency. It empowers players with control over their digital possessions, bolstering their sense of security.
Participation in the In-Game Economy: The wallet is indispensable for engaging in the in-game economy, encompassing activities like trading, item purchases, and receiving rewards. Without a wallet, players miss out on these exciting opportunities to shape their gaming journey.
Interactions with Other Players: A registered Mintbase wallet also acts as a trust signal among fellow players. It signifies a player's genuine commitment to the game, fostering trust among peers and increasing the likelihood of successful cooperation in various in-game activities.
Integration with Mintbase Technology: The game leverages Mintbase's cutting-edge technology for a range of features, and wallet registration is an essential prerequisite for seamless integration with this advanced tech stack.
In summary, registering a Mintbase wallet is essential for players to fully experience the game's offerings, harness its diverse features, and actively engage in its vibrant economy. The game design encourages wallet registration by making it a gateway to a more enriched and immersive gameplay experience.
