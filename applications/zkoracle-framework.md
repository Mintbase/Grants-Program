## Project Overview ðŸ“„

**Tag Line:** Streamlining Real-world Data Verification for Smart Contracts

**Brief Description:**
Usher Labs is embarking on an innovative project to develop a zkOracle Framework, designed to facilitate the creation of tailored ZKOracles that authenticate real-world data. This framework aims to empower Aurora and NEAR Smart Contracts to reliably verify cryptographic proofs pertaining to private data sourced from centralised operations or TLS-enabled HTTP endpoints. To showcase the framework's capabilities, we plan to implement a simple NFT project on Mintbase, where Tweets are minted with cryptographic assurance of uniqueness, preventing duplicate minting of the same tweet.

**Integration into the Mintbase / NEAR Ecosystem:**
Our project is intrinsically linked to the Mintbase and NEAR ecosystem. By enabling the minting of unique Tweet-based NFTs on Mintbase, we demonstrate the practical utility of our zkOracle Framework within the NEAR environment. This integration showcases how real-world data, verified via our framework, can enhance the authenticity and uniqueness of NFTs, adding tangible value to the Mintbase platform.

**Reason for Interest:**
Our motivation stems from Usher Labs' ongoing efforts in the Transparency Network. Our Transparency (T) Network addresses transparency challenges in centralised operations through the T Node, which enriches off-chain data with cryptographic proofs. The T Node functions as a Database, HTTP request Prover, and Proxy Interface, operating in tandem with our T (Notary) Network. It securely processes first-party data, private API/HTTP data, and third-party partner data. With our interest in zero-knowledge architecture, we aim to extend this functionality, enabling the proof of diverse real-world data on-chain, such as KYC/Identity and financial information. This project is a natural extension of our existing work and aligns with our vision to enhance data integrity and privacy on the blockchain.

### Project Details

**UI/Architecture Documentation:**

- **UI Mockups**: We have prepared detailed mockups for the dApp interface, designed for minting Tweet NFTs. These mockups provide a clear and intuitive user experience.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Transparency (T) Node and Network**: At the core of our project is the T Node, an advanced version of our already deployed Log Store Node. This technology specialises in generating cryptographic proofs for data, both published to and retrieved from, the network and HTTP endpoints.
- **Notary Proof for Twitter Data**: A key feature includes generating Notary Proofs for data obtained from Twitter's V2 API, ensuring the authenticity of NFTs representing Twitter data and their uniqueness based on Tweet IDs.
- **zkOracle Framework**: The framework will utilise ZKLLVM, a circuit compiler enabling Rust programming language to be compiled into ZK Circuits. We will leverage the Placeholder Proof System for verification within EVM environments.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Verification Smart Contracts will be deployed on Aurora, with integration into NEAR Smart Contracts for NFT minting and management via the Aurora Contracts SDK.
- **User Interface dApp**: A user-friendly Next.js based dApp will be developed, using existing open-source libraries for swift implementation. This dApp will facilitate the minting process of Twitter-based NFTs.

**Proof of Concept and Prior Work:**
Usher Labs has a strong track record, evident in our open-source libraries showcasing expertise in Rust programming, Smart Contract deployment across various blockchains, and Node and Network architecture development, exemplified by the Log Store.

**Project Scope and Expectations:**

- **Primary Focus**: The project is primarily aimed at providing developers with a streamlined zkOracle to authenticate real-world data on-chain.
- **Demonstration via Twitter and Mintbase**: While the creation of unique Twitter NFTs on Mintbase serves as an intriguing use case, it is primarily a means to demonstrate the broader utility of bridging real-world data with the NEAR blockchain.
- **Limitations**: It's important to note that while our project might catalyse a novel NFT collection on Mintbase, our main focus is on enhancing developer tools for real-world data verification in the NEAR ecosystem.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Integration into the Mintbase and NEAR Ecosystem:**
Our project is strategically positioned to enhance the NEAR blockchain, aligning with its goal of evolving into a comprehensive Blockchain Operating System. By enabling the verification of real-world data on-chain, our solution bridges the gap between familiar web2 services and the innovative capabilities of web3. Our initial demonstration via Mintbase, involving the creation of unique Twitter-derived NFTs, is a testament to this integration. This approach not only introduces an element of novelty and scarcity in the NFT space but also paves the way for advanced crypto payments and exchange functionalities integrated with social media platforms like Twitter.

**Target Audience:**
While our project might initially appeal to NFT enthusiasts intrigued by the novelty of Twitter-based NFTs, our core target audience extends far beyond. We are primarily focused on Web3 developers and enterprises looking to integrate real-world data verification within their blockchain applications. Our technology serves as a bridge for these entities to incorporate public and private data from traditional web2 platforms, enhancing their blockchain applications' functionality and security.

**Meeting Market Needs:**
Our project addresses a crucial need in the blockchain ecosystem â€“ the ability to verify real-world data in a transparent, secure, and cryptographically sound manner. This opens up new avenues for businesses to securely interact with traditional platforms like KYC, banking, finance, and ticketing, all while ensuring data integrity and security. Such capabilities are pivotal in advancing the practical use cases of blockchain technology in everyday business operations.

**Comparison with Existing Projects:**
To our knowledge, there are no direct counterparts within the NEAR or Mintbase ecosystems that offer similar functionalities. However, in the broader blockchain and Web3 domain, projects like HyperOracle, PadoLabs, and ZKPass have ventured into related areas. What sets our project apart is our specific focus on the NEAR ecosystem and our unique approach to integrating Twitter data into NFTs, providing a practical demonstration of our technology's potential. Our solution not only adds value to the NEAR blockchain in terms of data verification capabilities but also innovates in how social media interactions can be transformed into valuable, verifiable digital assets.
