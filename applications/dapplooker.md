Having worked with several NFT marketplaces and launchpads such as Decentraland, Axie Infinity, and Damned Pirates Society, we understand the problems and solutions when it comes to analyzing and assessing an NFT ecosystem. Along with this, we have worked closely with the NEAR Ecosystem and NEAR Dapps such as Metapool and Ref.Finance. We align with NEAR’s motto of putting usability first, this makes us provide key data metrics that in turn help build a data-driven ecosystem for NEAR.

Mintbase's Smart Contract Indexer will be leveraged to provide analytics and visualization to every smart contract/store launched and registered. Key Metrics Dashboards can be built to run analytics., smart contract data can be downloaded as CSV files, charts and dashboards can be embedded on websites, and charts and dashboards can be shared publicly and privately with the community.

With the NFT having such high compounding growth year on year, analytics plays a crucial role in tracking key performance metrics and adoption. DappLooker’s motto is “No-code community-driven analytics, helping build a data-driven web3” Based on the premise of this motto, DappLooker is interested in creating this project to support Mintbase and its Community. We want to provide Mintbase and its community with the power of analytics and help them make data-driven decisions.
