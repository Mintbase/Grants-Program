## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- Name: QPR Lockeroom - Bringing football fans closer to the game.
- The project sees QPR FC selling blocks of turf from their stadium renovation go on sale as physical blocks of grass with digital twin NFTs that have historic moments attached to them. The club will also be providing hyper-casual gaming with blockchain collectibles and reward incentives for fans who participate in this lockeroom project. This all sync up with the existing sign-in, rewards, merch store and other QPR fan engagement activities the club is using for fans.
- Project relation NEAR / Mintbase ecosystem - We bring sports IP to the ecosystem, we bring competitive casual gaming to the ecosystem and an open loyalty program for people who engage with the project, partners and collaborators. 
- Our Interests: We are looking for an infrastructure partner who can help simplify the generation of wallets, minting of NFTs and payment gateways. We are also looking at platform partners who are actively interested in gaming and sports.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- Technology stack - AWS, S3, Cloudfront, Jenkins, MongoDB, Stripe Checkout, GitLabs, Sentry monitoring, Storybook, Solidity, React.js, Next.js, Mintbase.js, RUST, Javascript.
- Backend - The backend is AWS cloud-hosted. Servers in Singapore, Sydney and London. Media hosted via S3 buckets. We are fully optimised for scaling with load balancing enabled.
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- Using a security.txt file for vulnerabilities
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
  - It is not sports betting
  - It is not a fantasy league
  - It is not just NFTs we build to make NFTs usable

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience? We are building sports collectibles and engagement products for sports leagues. We are B2B focused but we enable the IP Partner to be B2C to their sports community.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/mintbase/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem - The QPR club addressed some desire to expand on its offering to its fanbase. They have a significant global audience but only serve the local community. The problem is servicing the global community with online products and experience upgrades for their fandom. To our knowledge there is no academic research papers on this specific use case.
- links - We have Git issues housed in our GitLabs account. We can share these with the reviewer on request. 
- Interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes - We can share this with the reviewer on request, housed in a QPR Figma board. 

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- Platform build, styling, payment gateways - December 2023 - January 2024
- Commencement of Mintbase integration - $30k - upon receipt of funds (ASAP) Feb 2024
- Code review pre launch - March 2024 - $10k
- Launch - late March 2024 - $10k


### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project ongoing.
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  3-4 people 1 from QPR and 3 from Animoca.
- **Total Costs:** TBD 

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Mintbase Modules

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Mintbase nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)
| 1. | Mintbase module: X | We will create a Mintbase / NEAR module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be implemented for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Mintbase module: Y | We will create a Mintbase / NEAR module that will... |  
| 3. | Mintbase module: Z | We will create a Mintbase / NEAR module that will... |

## Future Plans

Please include here

- We are partnered with QPR FC to create a new way they can engage fans with the club's history, IRL operations and expand their online activities. This partnership is looking long term at growing their global fanbase and expanding on the activities available to current members. Both companies have resources dedicated to the operations of this project. We have a list of collaborations we will be rolling into the project along with activations with the QPR FC sponsors.
- We have joint marketing efforts to expand and grow the project and are actively seeking collaborators and sponsors to become involved.
