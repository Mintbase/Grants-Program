### Overview

Please provide the following:

- Zapier for Web3
- The workflows between the web3 tools is broken due to lack of automation. The dearth of no code tool to automate workflows further causes the bottlenecks in the non-developer communities.We are building no-code workflow automation suite for web3 Tools. We are zapier for web3.
- We would also give no-code access to your network Dapps with other Dapps. I would like to discuss about the Dapp API permissions from the your network to integrate with others. 
- I like communities strong and where people do not lose interest by having to do a lot of manual tasks. We keep the manual work people have to do to the minimal by automating them. I like to see your network have much broader adoption and even having non-tech people part of the network actively engaging in the space.
