# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Overlewd NFT proposal
- **Team Name:** SupaDoge
- **Payment Address:** ponyunicorn.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 2


## Project Overview ðŸ“„

### Overview

Supa doge is developing a platform for creators and gamers enabling a content-oriented model of distribution and monetization.

Our goal is to become the Roblox for web3.

The key USP is supporting cross-functional economy in various games through token price discovery.

Our founders previously managed independent studios creating profitable projects with up to 6-figure revenue streams, and managed esports communities.
We launched last year to produce three titles and bootstrapped and raised $1 MLN for development, first title in soft launch.

We are raising our seed round to develop the tools required to shift how the market perceives monetization and drive 60 MLN gamers into our platform!


### Project Details

Integration of NEAR into the game through the web3 event, where the NFT collection of improved characters will be introduced.

Web3 event will allow users to get unique NFTs that unlock access to improved characters and equipment. Tokens will be minted on behalf of Supa Doge DAO on the Mintbase contract. Some of them will be airdroped when user registers for the event, the other part will be distributed as a reward for completing levels.

To register on the web3 event, a user has to login to NEAR. To make this possible, we will develop an authorization module for Unity, which will be open sourced. After a user logs in, we will link blockchain account with his profile and will send NFT. It will be displayed both in the game and on Mainbase. And we will also place links to Mintbase from our interface to introduce player to the marketplace.

Rarest and most unique characters will be available on Mintbase only and won't be airdroped, they should be purchased. An advertisement will be placed inside the game, which will lead to Mintbase where a player will find rare assets.

Thus, in order to make a web3 event and attract the attention of users, we need:

- Complete gameplay for the web3 3 months event
- Produce new characters and its equipment design
- Mint huge NFT collection of game special resources
- Create Unity bindings for in-game NEAR authrization
- API service integration that transfers tokens to players

#### Technology stack

- Unity
- Node.js / Nest.js
- NEAR / near-api-js
- Mintbase API


### Ecosystem Fit

With crypto becoming more prominent day by day, and more and more people are looking for opportunities to easily get acquainted with it. Adopting a new payable audience from adult gaming and monetization is our main goals. For collaboration, we need existing tools and support from Mintbase. This will give our players the possibility to interact using assets not only in the game. All it needed is mintbase contact, API marketplace and co-promotion.

### Overview

The release is scheduled for the 3rd quarter of 2023. By this point, the game will be released into production and have an active paying audience.

We plan to create an event, prepare a storyline, make art and the assets necessary for it, as well as write documentation on the event. In parallel, we will begin work on the integration of the NEAR and mintbase API both on the client and on the server.

After a month of development, we plan to build a test apk with an event where you can watch draft integration with the blockchain.

After that, we will need to update the game mechanics, the characteristics of new characters and the parameters of game levels, it will take another month of development and bringing the art to the end.
