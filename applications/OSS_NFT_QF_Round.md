# Mintbase Grant Proposal

* Project Name: Quadratic Funding Round for Open Source NFT Public Goods
* Team Name: ASAC (Anti Social Ape Club)
* Payment Address: _pot.potlock.near (will deploy pot and have that address be funding)
* Level: 2


## Project Overview ðŸ“„


### High level overview 
* Creating a quadratic funding round on PotLock for $20,000 USD (in NEAR) to be facilitated by the Antisocial Ape Club for Open Source NFT projects on NEAR occurring in March
* **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">All funds will go directly to the matching round for projects</span>**, and ASAC will be facilitating this at no cost to support the NFT ecosystem and have alignment with NEAR


### Objectives 



* Create new funding mechanisms for NFT outside of bottom down proposal approach, rather than top down funding by council
* Experiment with Mintbase grants and bring publicity to potential projects and future rounds
* Serve as a pipeline to bootstrapping projects into Tier 1, funding in the grants program
* Shift culture for NFT based projects to build more open source tooling rather than closed sourced projects
* Drive external capital outside of NEAR Foundation & NDC to NFT community
* Setup project profiles for open source NFT projects and use as a place to community to get updates, put attestations, and track funding
* Create engage for on-chain activity through direct donations, matched amounts
* Gauge how much support each NFT community has and use as reputation in future funding rounds
* Enroll projects to get year round donations for plural funding sources
* Get other plays to contribute to matching round as traction increases


### Why



* Currently there is no way to support open source NFT projects directly. 
* Often those who do not get accepted for grants die and ideas are buried.
* Only top down approaches to funding from NEAR Foundation.


### Overview


### Project Details


### Ecosystem Fit

NEAR is supporting many open source projects, however it is a relatively nascent ecosystem, we don't know what builders want and how they will support. By encouraging projects to support open source innovation especially in the NFT space, not only will we be encouraging the developer community to build, but for builders to market what they are building. PotLock is  the first public goods funding platform on NEAR. 

Encourage other NFT communities in the space. One of our main OKRs as ASAC is to assist projects get funding, build open source, and bring projects from other ecosystems into NEAR. We believe in quadratic funding (with platforms like Gitcoin generating $50 million and onboarding thousands of projects)  It is important to note that this is ASAC applying to facilitate a quadratic funding round without taking a cut, and not to support PotLock development. 


# KPIs



* 10 NFT Open source projects onboarded
* 50 posts on social.near from donations
* 100,000 + social media impressions
* $7,000 raised in external donations (35% of matched amount)
* 100+ unique donations form round
* 100+ unique humans verified through nada.bot 

Why PotLock



* Only way in NEAR Ecosystem to express funding support
* Other people can also dynamically contribute to funding round in a permissionless way
* Once projects sign up they can continue to receive funding 
* Onboards projects to NEAR Social and NEAR Horizon
* Can track projects in the ecosystem 
* Marketing support by engaging donors
