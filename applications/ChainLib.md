## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

ChainLib is a dapp built and functioning on the NEAR blockchain. ChainLib - a digital NFT library, an open NFT marketplace created for authors providing a "shelf space" and visibility to their readers, with copyright protection ensured by blockchain technology.
We aim to expand the traditional functionality of NFT, by implementing generative art into books as NFTs generation methodology. Our project introduces a new concept - personalized books minted programmatically as NFT based on predefined NFT owner’s parameters. Generative art in itself is a fundamental medium that challenges our concept of art creation and value, offering endless possibilities of automated artworks with every run of the program. Now imagine what new horizons can be touched by bringing generative art into the book industry. 


### Overview

ChainLib - a digital NFT library, an open NFT marketplace for authors providing a "shelf space" and visibility to their readers, with copyright protection ensured by blockchain technology.
Authors sell their works as NFTs on Chainlib. Readers can buy the works and create their own collections and sell/trade them. The author will get a royalty fee for each NFT trade. 

**How our project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem**
ChainLib is a dapp built and functioning on the NEAR blockchain, accepting offers and payments in Near. We aim to extend NFT marketplace functionality by implementing :
●  	Personalized story tales as NFTs - programmable story tales as NFTs with predefined reader’s parameters. I.E. story tales for children. Parents can order books with their child right inside the story. All they need is add their child’s name, sex, age, even image and our platform will mint a personalized NFT containing the story tale with their child inside it. It remains only to order a printed copy of the book with created personalized NFT
●  	Generative NFT books powered by non-human system to generate new content programmatically, constantly manipulating the variable possibilities. Imagine that You bought an NFT containing a story tale with Your child inside it. Now imagine that this NFT is programmed to generate from-time-to-time new story tales with Your child inside it, with the same predefined reader’s parameters. A new story could be unlocked any time for NFT owners. All they have to do is periodically check their NFT status on our platform.  
We aim to develop on Mintbase the functionality described above. Thus we hope to extend existing functionality of our platform and of Mintbase, as well.
 
**Why are we doing this?** Initially, we were a team of authors and illustrators from a small country from Europe. At this moment we have more than 10 books with fairy tales published and 20 more books in various writing/publishing stages. In 2020, we published Christmas Tales for ages 0+ and 7-12 in a small print run of 1000 copies, and in 2021 we successfully sold the entire print run, donating money to charity. We have a signed agreement with one of the biggest publishing agencies in our country, which allows us to distribute our books through the bookstores network in 2 countries from Europe. When registering copyright on our books, we found out that it covers only the territory of our country, which is very strange and unfair to the authors. Basically, anyone outside our country can take any of our books and publish them under their name. This is how the idea with Chainlib was born. Aside from the authors’ copyright protection problem there is another one we want to solve. Most publishers find it difficult to accept new emerging writers. This is why we created an NFT marketplace for books and other works, where any author can upload his/her works and sell them as NFTs to its audience. Our team now includes developers, designers and other IT staff. If the legislation cannot solve the authors' problems, the technology should do it.

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project emerges on the digital library market as a solution meant to kill the biggest authors' problems: copyright protection and direct access to their readers without intermediaries. We want to enhance new information exchange methods between authors’ and readers. We expect a great popularity among authors and, especially readers, as we seek to implement borderless opportunities of NFT and generative art. Programmable books can be a new page in a digital library’s history. A lot of users should embrace this new books generating methodology. 
This is what we aim to bring with us: a lot of new users that will enlarge the blockchain’s community; brand new technology that will extend the NFT standard. 

**Target audience**
Our target audience include 2 categories of users: readers and authors
With regards to readers, currently these are families with children from 0 to 16 years old. M - 10%, W - 90%; Age - 24-50 years; Income - medium+; Currently, sales take place in Moldova. The next target market - Romania/Ukraine. Next - the countries of Eastern Europe.
We expect a much broader audience that shall enlarge due to new authors coming on Chainlib with their works

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in USN, and potentially NEAR and nUSDC, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
