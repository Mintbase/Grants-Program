## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

ChainLib is a dapp built and functioning on the NEAR blockchain. ChainLib - a digital NFT library, an open NFT marketplace created for authors providing a "shelf space" and visibility to their readers, with copyright protection ensured by blockchain technology.
We aim to expand the traditional functionality of NFT, by implementing generative art into books as NFTs generation methodology. Our project introduces a new concept - personalized books minted programmatically as NFT based on predefined NFT owner’s parameters. Generative art in itself is a fundamental medium that challenges our concept of art creation and value, offering endless possibilities of automated artworks with every run of the program. Now imagine what new horizons can be touched by bringing generative art into the book industry. 


### Overview

ChainLib - a digital NFT library, an open NFT marketplace for authors providing a "shelf space" and visibility to their readers, with copyright protection ensured by blockchain technology.
Authors sell their works as NFTs on Chainlib. Readers can buy the works and create their own collections and sell/trade them. The author will get a royalty fee for each NFT trade. 

**How our project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem**
ChainLib is a dapp built and functioning on the NEAR blockchain, accepting offers and payments in Near. We aim to extend NFT marketplace functionality by implementing :
- **Personalized story tales as NFTs** - programmable story tales as NFTs with predefined reader’s parameters. I.E. story tales for children. Parents can order books with their child right inside the story. All they need is add their child’s name, sex, age, even image and our platform will mint a personalized NFT containing the story tale with their child inside it. It remains only to order a printed copy of the book with created personalized NFT
- **Generative NFT books powered by non-human system to generate new content programmatically**, constantly manipulating the variable possibilities. Imagine that You bought an NFT containing a story tale with Your child inside it. Now imagine that this NFT is programmed to generate from-time-to-time new story tales with Your child inside it, with the same predefined reader’s parameters. A new story could be unlocked any time for NFT owners. All they have to do is periodically check their NFT status on our platform.  
We aim to develop on Mintbase the functionality described above. Thus we hope to extend existing functionality of our platform and of Mintbase, as well.
 
**Why are we doing this?** 
Initially, we were a team of authors and illustrators from a small country from Europe. At this moment we have more than 10 books with fairy tales published and 20 more books in various writing/publishing stages. In 2020, we published Christmas Tales for ages 0+ and 7-12 in a small print run of 1000 copies, and in 2021 we successfully sold the entire print run, donating money to charity. We have a signed agreement with one of the biggest publishing agencies in our country, which allows us to distribute our books through the bookstores network in 2 countries from Europe. When registering copyright on our books, we found out that it covers only the territory of our country, which is very strange and unfair to the authors. Basically, anyone outside our country can take any of our books and publish them under their name. This is how the idea with Chainlib was born. Aside from the authors’ copyright protection problem there is another one we want to solve. Most publishers find it difficult to accept new emerging writers. This is why we created an NFT marketplace for books and other works, where any author can upload his/her works and sell them as NFTs to its audience. Our team now includes developers, designers and other IT staff. If the legislation cannot solve the authors' problems, the technology should do it.

Currently, we are working on adding new functionality to our NFT marketplace:
- Personalized story tales as NFTs
- Generative NFT books powered by non-human system to generate new content programmatically

Below You can see how the personalized story tales look IRL:

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project emerges on the digital library market as a solution meant to kill the biggest authors' problems: copyright protection and direct access to their readers without intermediaries. We want to enhance new information exchange methods between authors’ and readers. We expect a great popularity among authors and, especially readers, as we seek to implement borderless opportunities of NFT and generative art. Programmable books can be a new page in a digital library’s history. A lot of users should embrace this new books generating methodology. 
This is what we aim to bring with us: a lot of new users that will enlarge the blockchain’s community; brand new technology that will extend the NFT standard. 

**Target audience**
Our target audience include 2 categories of users: readers and authors
- With regards to readers, currently these are families with children from 0 to 16 years old. M - 10%, W - 90%; Age - 24-50 years; Income - medium+; Currently, sales take place in Moldova. The next target market - Romania/Ukraine. Next - the countries of Eastern Europe.
- We expect a much broader audience that shall enlarge due to new authors coming on Chainlib with their works

**What need(s) does your project meet?**

For users:
- Personalization - with new functionality we solve a great demand for personalized content (stories with You or Your child the main heroes)
- Access to programmable art - new stories created programmatically based on your parameters, dropped as NFT
- Ownership - You owb Your stories through NFT

For authors:
- Ownership - Right book holders cannot effectively control the use of their work on the Internet
- Decentralization - no intermediaries between authors and readers
- Access to audience - Most publishers find it difficult to accept new emerging writers 

**Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?**
- There are a few project connected with the book industry. However, most of these projects are in early development stage. Additionally, our project has oustanding idea (Personalized story tales as NFTs + Generative NFT books) confirmed by sales IRL
- There are similar projects in web2 (personalized stories). However, our Generative NFT books concept makes our project innovative and different from our competiotion. ?
