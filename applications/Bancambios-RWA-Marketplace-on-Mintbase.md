### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components - Yes.
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used: Minsta SDK, Mintbase SDK, Mintbase Wallet, idOS, FastAuth SD.
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed: NEP366, Refferal System, Enterprise SUb Account Management, Relayer for FT Swap, NEP366, SubAccounts, MetaTransactions, Delegate Action, NameSky, NEAR Names, Burner Wallets, Refferal System.
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic. > Not yet ready.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement. > Hard to say but We will not implement voting services.
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? Phygital NFT Makretplace as e-commerce, idOS implementation, phygital marketplace, hispanic and latin america audience onboarding.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? Physical Shops, Hispanic speaking audience on Web3, regular users of Web2 e-commerce, Artists, collectibles, sellers and buyers of vehicles, sellers and buyers or phygital items, those looking for alternative tokenized assets, and RWA market.
- What need(s) does your project meet? To prepare to launch fully operational platform, gather a ling of first users, prepare adoption to first users/clients, define KPI from the product, Team composision, support Tech Team, allign roadmap, budgeting, outlook the continuation of the project, and fundraiser.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem? Not in on NEAR Protocol.
  - If so, how is your project different? 
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems? Not really, there is one on ETH for shops in Dubai but they focused on fashion only.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/mintbase/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Mintbase Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

## Future Plans

Please include here

- Onboarding exhisting Web3 users using: Minsta for Bancambios, Bancambios Sellers, Buyers, Bancambios Database of Carbon Credit Buyers, Mexican Web3 Users, NEAR Ecosystem.
- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term: During 2022 and 2023 we did several events, meetups, side-events. We have been gathering database. We will use this database to promote at first. Then we have other partners who can help us get more promotion and awareness on our product. Additionally this year the NEAR ecossytem is aiming to grow in Latin america, and we plan to join some activations together.
- and the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it. > We will continue working together, if some other team members cannot continue with Bancambios full-time they can always welcome to be consultants. Bancambios will ensure the project continues going.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: The most important is to build the technology, then we will find market fit.
