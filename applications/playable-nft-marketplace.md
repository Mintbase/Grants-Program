# Mintbase Grant Proposal

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
AMBER Playable NFT Marketplace based on Mintbase technology. 

Our proposal is to develop a Playable NFT Marketplace Based on AMBER Open-source Metaverse, which will be the Playable NFT Marketplace powered by Mintbase technology with virtual asseet ownership confirmation and in-game NFT utility. Users will be able to get virtual assets through an interactive NFT lootbox, give them to other users and trade them on the secondary market. Virtual assets have rarity rarity and utility use of these skins in games and metaverse. The code of project will then be put into an open-source repository that will allow any blockchain applications and game creators to create marketplaces of this kind. The first will be a collection of 8888 3D avatars that will be used in the game. With AMBER technology it is possible to mint weapons, vehicles, real estate and land and use them in metaverse & NFT games. Also it's necessary to develop and implement a marketing strategy through which we plan to involve users to buy virtual property on AMBER and Mintbase platforms.  When the project is launched anyone may become a creator and trader of virtual property by verifying account on the Marketplace and publishing own designs for NFT-assets. The Marketplace will provide a unique user experience related to gaming and buying in-game skins. As part of the project it is also planned to create a nft lootbox with the drop of things of different rarity and different mechanics of how items are dropped. 


### Project Details

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMBER-Open-Source-Metaverse/UX-wireframe-for-playable-NFT-marketplace-powered-by-Mintbase/master/2-App-Marketplace.png)

We will prepare a grey layout describing our NFT marketplace idea 

We will use a technical method proposed by NEAR, which means using smart contracts on the backend and some frontend 
s
We assume that the marketplace will be developed in JavaScript (React) with Gatsby and hosted on Neltify. Also possible integration with our C# backend, a plugin for the Unity game engine that communicates with the Mintbase API and allows downloading, streaming, caching  NFT from the storage directly to the while playing the game and utilise the NFT as playable NFT asset.

At the moment we have an MVP of a third person shooter game which already uses NFT from the Mintbase marketplace. An example is deployed at https://amber.top where when you run the WebGl game (desktop only Chrome Firefox) you will get an nft avatar where the forever_media whith is attached to NFT by Mintbase smart-contract is streamed from IPFS into the game environment using our plugin. We also have an iPhone game that works the same way and is available for installation via the AppStore Testflight (Iphone 12+ Only)

The outcome of the project will not so much be an improvement to the AMBER gaming environment, at the same time it will be a huge improvement to the web frontend for the user - a marketplace application in which the user makes NFT mint and trades

### Ecosystem Fit

There is the problem of adapting blockchain for the masses, namely NFT and their utility. Our project allows the web2 user to learn about the world of blockchain and seamlessly move into using NFT in everyday life as playable items. 

Our solution enables the use of direct marketing channels such as targeted advertising and social media and Influencer marketing to sell nft as an item, add value by confirming ownership of the digital asset, solve the problem of user personalization in the metaverse and provide an example of the new economy for blockchain games 

There are other projects in the NEAR ecosystem with a similar approach, as interest in the play 2 own (web2 -free 2 play) economy grows, projects come together and agree on collaboration between projects and cross-utility. Such a solution as a marketplace for game assets and an example of their utilisation in the form of a game, as well as the open source of such a solution, will enable the future to become a common standard for game nft and to share their use freely. In this way, the NEAR community will be able to come closer to realising the metaverse - connecting virtual worlds based on blockchain together into a multiverse and improving the use of blockchain by the general consumer.

## Development Status :open_book:

This is part of the larger AMBER Open Source metaverse repository which is a microservice architecture of various services and plugins, modules and examples related to bringing blockchain into game development

We have recently developed and continue to iterate the frontend based on our ux research, grey layouts and ui design of a new minting page for Tenk DAO's frontend starter with NFT game integration and advise on upgrading their smart contract so that it supports the forever_media metadata from Mintbase and supports the use of .gltf .glb files from the storage

## Future Plans
The closest milestone after marketplace creation is the development of collections of playable nft such as weapons, transport, real estate, land

AMBER is planned as a long-term project, with full functionality to be available by 2028. By that time, we plan to refine our game and add a battle royal mode to it, and we are also working on the design of our own combat mode with procedurally generated worlds. We also plan to create a 3D social network supported by AR/VR devices with spatial audio and voice chat based on AMBER. We also plan to add to the AMBER universe the possibility of hosting your own space, e.g. for a product or an event. There will be some collaboration with other metaverse projects and NFT games with full integration of their NFT in the same multi-universe. Amber is also a platform as a service where anyone can build something based on AMBER. For that, we have provided a separate app, AMBER creator, which is in essence a world creator.  This doesn't mean we won't see amber in release sooner, what we mean is that the amount of work is very large and it will take years to implement all the functionality we have in mind. 



## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** 

We found out about the grant because we communicate with the Mintbase team on a daily basis and we are working together on new utilities for the NFT and we are a product of the NEAR and Mintbase ecosystem
