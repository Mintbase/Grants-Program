### Overview

Please provide the following:

- NameSky is the first marketplace to buy and sell NEAR accounts as NFTs.
- We allow users to trade near accounts (through NFT) on Mintbase.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

Q: Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
In the NEAR blockchain, there is no good way to trade NEAR accounts on a scale. NameSky is solving this problem by leveraging the power of the NFT protocol and making it possible to trade NEAR accounts easily and safely in scale. Also, NameSky is a utility-heavy NFT project that can show the good use case of the NFT protocol. 



Q: Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

1. First of all, **myself**, **Demo Chen**. I desperately want to have the NEAR account `demo.near` as my identity on the NEAR blockchain, but that account is already registered by someone else. I have no way to even make an offer to him to buy `demo.near`.

2. **NEAR account collectors and investors**. It's a proven business both in the web2 and the web3 world. It's very rewarding when you invested early in web domain names or ENS names.
3. **Founders and Bussiness Owners**. They always want a good NEAR account for people to remember their brand and identity. NameSky is the place for them to find the NEAR accounts they want. 




Q: What need(s) does your project meet?
- NameSky makes it possible to turn a NEAR account into an NFT and vice versa
- NameSky has a dedicated marketplace front to buy/sell NEAR accounts (as NFTs)
- NameSky makes NEAR account sales discoverable through a Twitter bot [NEAR accounts sales bot](https://twitter.com/nearaccountsbot)

Q: Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?

There are few prior projects that to trade NEAR accounts, NameSky is the first one that takes advantage of the NFT protocol and also provides an easy-to-use interface to make NEAR account trading approachable, scalable and reliable.
