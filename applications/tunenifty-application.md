## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This is our first grant application for this project.

### Overview

Tunenifty is a proposed NFT stream-to-own app.

We would be building a music streaming application that allows users to own the music after streaming it a certain number of times. They would also have the option of converting the music into NFTs.

Content streaming apps are still not yet very popular in the Mintbase/NEAR ecosytem yet, but having a successful platform would not only help grow the number of users, but would help bring the ecosystem further mainstream, as well as help creatives and fans connect and make a living.

We are trying to develop a fairer income distribution model, a means for fans to support their favorite artists, as well as a way for both fans and creators to benefit from the relationships. 

### Project Details

Tunenifty is a proposed Stream to Own music NFT streaming platform. Users would pay a flat fee into their Tunenifty wallets. This would not be a monthly charge, but for as often as they listen to music. Each stream would be assigned a value, and each time a user streams a song, a certain amount would be debited from the wallet. Once a certain number of streams have been reached, the music automatically becomes available to the streamer for download. For collections (eg EPs and Albums) once the user spends upto a certain amount on the album, the entire album is theirs to own and download.

#### What NiftyTunes is Not

NiftyTunes  would not yet be a finished product. We expect some experimentation on how to convert collections to NFTs, payment modes, minting, etc.

#### Techonology

Technology 1: JavaScript

Technology 2: Vue

Technology 3: Arweave/Akash


### Ecosystem Fit



- We are building an NFT musicstreaming platform.
- Our target audience includes music creators and music consumers.
- We meet a need for fairer, web" alternatives to Spotify et, al.
- As far as we know, there are currently no similar projects in the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/mintbase/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Mintbase Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Mintbase Modules

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
