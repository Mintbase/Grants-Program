**1.2** **Project Overview** 


**1.2.1** **Project Introduction**

Tunenifty is an NFT streaming platform that hopes to solve the problem where creators are paid very little for their work, streamers are usually not able to directly support their favorite artists,
and make it possible for content to be valuable for the both creators and fans.

**1.3** **Project details**  
Tunenifty is a proposed `Stream to Own` music NFT streaming platform. Users would pay a flat fee into their Tunenifty wallets. This would not be a monthly
charge, but for as often as they listen to music. Each stream would be assigned a value, and each time a user streams a song, a certain amount would be debited from
the wallet. Once a certain number of streams have been reached, the music automatically becomes available to the streamer for download. For collections (eg `EPs` and `Albums`) once the user spends upto a certain amount on the album, the entire album is theirs to own and download.

Once a streamer has an album, they may decide to either do nothing, or to unlock NFTs. This may usually be buy buying NFTs (which may include extra content or features).
