Tunenifty is a proposed NFT stream-to-own app.

We would be building a music streaming application that allows users to own the music after streaming it a certain number of times. They would also have the option of converting the music into NFTs.

Content streaming apps are still not yet very popular in the Mintbase/NEAR ecosytem yet, but having a successful platform would not only help grow the number of users, but would help bring the ecosystem further mainstream, as well as help creatives and fans connect and make a living.

We are trying to develop a fairer income distribution model, a means for fans to support their favorite artists, as well as a way for both fans and creators to benefit from the relationships. 

### Project Details

Tunenifty is a proposed Stream to Own music NFT streaming platform. Users would pay a flat fee into their Tunenifty wallets. This would not be a monthly charge, but for as often as they listen to music. Each stream would be assigned a value, and each time a user streams a song, a certain amount would be debited from the wallet. Once a certain number of streams have been reached, the music automatically becomes available to the streamer for download. For collections (eg EPs and Albums) once the user spends upto a certain amount on the album, the entire album is theirs to own and download.

#### What Tunenifty is Not

Tunenifty would not yet be a finished product. We expect some experimentation on how to convert collections to NFTs, payment modes, minting, etc.

#### Techonology

Technology 1: JavaScript

Technology 2: Vue/React

Technology 3: Arweave/Akash


### Ecosystem Fit



- We are building an NFT music streaming platform.
- Our target audience includes music creators and music consumers.
- We meet a need for fairer, web" alternatives to Spotify et, al.
- As far as we know, there are currently no similar projects in the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem
