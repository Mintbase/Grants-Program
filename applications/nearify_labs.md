# Project Overview

## Overview

NEARify Labs

We combine automated Web3 tooling, professional experience, and world class service to make NFT and Crypto community management easier.

Nearify Labs prides itself on being the most widely used verification service on NEAR. While providing a host of other tools such as sales, listing, floor trackers, and security bots our main focus is having the most advanced verification which we are constantly upgrading.

Our tool services over 50 clients and 200,000 users. Once a project has finished their mint and listed on one of the marketplaces we then add our bot to their server to create the verification channel where a holder interacts and is given certain roles and special access to holder only channels. The verification can be multi collection, for staked NFTs, by number of NFTs and soon by traits and rarity.

We originally came from a Solana DAO project and while ‘degen-ing’ around we became interested in the NEAR NFTs space. Our team built a few tools as they saw a gap in the NFT market. We enjoy building and further improving our services and helping develop the NEAR ecosystem as we get to know all the players and projects. While some blockchains are undergoing their mid life crises we are focused on the NEAR future. 

## Project Details

Our initial product is live and you can check on the details on [https://nearifylabs.com/](https://nearifylabs.com/) . Our solutions are scalable and currently being used over 200,000 NEAR community members. We have various products that are aimed at improving the NEAR NFT ecosystem. 

NFT verifications system :
This is our core components which uses discord API and NEAR chain to verify the holder of a particular assets on the NEAR ecosystem.

Sales , Listing system :

This system tracks the marketplace sales from Paras [ market place on NEAR ].

Rarity ranking system:
This system ranks each NFT on a particular collection based on the NFT’s collective traits.

We are looking to improve the entire ecosystem, focusing on better UI/UX and optimization standpoint. 

## Ecosystem Fit

Our project fits quite simply into every collections’ roadmap. We are there to setup the day a project has minted out, hype is high, and the community is excited to get verified and gain access to holder only channels where they can talk with their fellow investors and be granted the roles that they can show-off and identify one another. 

Our target audience is any and all NFT collections; PFP or utility type including NFT games. While we have had some interest from smaller 1/1 artists, 99% of our business is from collections ranging from 100-10,000+. We also form partnerships with marketplaces, launchpads, and other utility projects for referrals and mutual benefits. 

We turn NFTs into special keys that unlock the doors into new worlds. We enable holders to gather together, form DAOs and governance councils, and deepen their involvement with the project. We create visible and special roles for holders that prove their commitment. 

There are several competitors out there, and new ones popping up. Many of these projects have a multitude of utilities they wish to develop. Sales bots, Listing bots, games, volume/floor/sniper/analysis/tracking tools, launchpads, marketplaces. Our focus is Verification and any other systems that can benefit from it. We developed supporting tools such as sales and listing to bundle for our customers but verification is our primary service. And therefore we put a % of all our revenue into upgrading our verification to be the most advanced on NEAR and expand our servers to handle the growing load of customers. 

We also developed a cross chain verification service that we will utilize for onboarding more communities and participants into the NEAR ecosystem.

We are a team of 4 who can move quickly and efficiently without having several 100 or even 10,000 NFT community holders to manage.
