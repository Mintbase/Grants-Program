# **[Mintbase Grant Proposal](https://github.com/codingshot/Mintbase-Genadrop-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/application-template.md#mintbase-grant-proposal)**



* Project Name: MintBOS by GenaDrop
* Team Name: [Minority Programmers Association](https://minorityprogrammers.org)
* Payment Address: drop.sputnik-dao.near 
* [Level](https://github.com/codingshot/Mintbase-Genadrop-Grants-Program/blob/main/README.md#level_slider-levels): 1


## **[Project Overview üìÑ](https://github.com/codingshot/Mintbase-Genadrop-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/application-template.md#project-overview-page_facing_up)**


### High level overview 

([mintbase.genadrop.xyz](https://mintbase.genadrop.xyz))



* creating feature parity with mint base contracts, storefronts and single minter as well as ui
* Integrating DAO & Social features to mintbase toolkit
* Mono repos for deploying and customizing components and gateway
* Adding Meta Transactions to telegram wallet bot wallet.genadrop.xyz 
* Documentation, workshops, and marketing surrounding product


### Objectives 



* Develop a system where anyone, DAO can create, manage, mint NEAR NFTs leveraging Mintbase contracts & indexers
* Develop any easy to use tool kit leveraging BOS for anyone to create their own style mintbase store front so mintbase can focus on innovating NFT infrastructure
* Extend mintbase to interacts more with social.near data, and DAO functionality


### Why



* mintbase started the first nft components on bOS alongside our team at GenaDrop but hasn‚Äôt shipped BOS related components since EthDenver
* Many creative communities are DAOs and astro function call libraries are not up to date and don‚Äôt have dao functionality built into the flow üèõÔ∏è
* Mission of mintbase to build infra and proliferate infrastructure their needs to be front end 


### **[Overview](https://github.com/codingshot/Mintbase-Genadrop-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/application-template.md#overview)**

The following proposal is to achieve Mintbase feature parity on BOS as composable mobile responsive components extended with DAO + Social features. Additionally, we will be adding mintbase listing metatransactions to our[ telegram account abstraction wallet](https://wallet.genadrop.xyz). 

We will be building Mintbos entirely on Mintbase Infra: Builds on Mintbase factory and storefront, leverages graphQL, and creates front ends for action libraries for sputnik daos on mintbase contracts, and uses social.near contract for profiles for storefront + collections and feeds. 

We are interested in creating this project as we want all Mintbase functionality on BOS, while providing easy theme customization.  We started building some Mintbase components on BOS, and communities have asked for this of us. We also are interested in combining mintbase with BOS + social.near ecosystem and to empower DAOs to operate. 


### **[Project Details](https://github.com/codingshot/Mintbase-Genadrop-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/application-template.md#project-details)**

### **[Ecosystem Fit](https://github.com/codingshot/Mintbase-Genadrop-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/application-template.md#ecosystem-fit)**

Our project aims to establish itself as the go-to composable boilerplate for NFTs within the NEAR ecosystem. We cater to creative communities, DAOs, NFT ecosystems, front-end developers, and startups seeking to rapidly develop immersive and customizable NFT experiences. Additionally, through our Telegram integration, we facilitate seamless NFT minting and listing, enabling users to begin earning within the ecosystem without incurring fees.

Currently, Mintbase and our project are the sole ventures actively developing BOS NFT solutions. Our focus lies in accelerating NFT ecosystem development and fostering continuous engagement with communities, leveraging social graphs to enhance distribution. This allows Mintbase to concentrate on infrastructure while empowering more communities to construct diverse front-ends. While we possess our own NFT collection factory contracts, we are prioritizing Mintbase's contracts due to their expertise in NEAR NFT infrastructure.

We firmly uphold the narrative that NEAR represents the open web stack, and the need for more complex BOS native applications to bolster this. We also advocate for the distribution of gateways to strengthen the decentralization narrative. In the future, we envision leveraging chain abstraction to establish an attention layer for NFTs within social communities, fostering a social environment where individuals can interact, create, customize, and transact.

### **[Milestone 3](https://github.com/codingshot/Mintbase-Genadrop-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/application-template.md#milestone-2-example--additional-features): Extend Social, DAO Functionality, Telegram Integration & Product Marketing**



* Estimated Duration: 1.5 month
* FTE: 4
* Costs: 5,000 USD

This is where we extend profiles, DAO, creators, to all have social profiles (followers, posts, forums, etc), and we enable DAO functionality of NFTs. Additionally, we add metatransactions for listing NFTs in our Telegram Wallet. We also add documentation and have workshops upon product launch so other people can easily customize Mintbos for their use case.

## **[Future Plans](https://github.com/codingshot/Mintbase-Genadrop-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/application-template.md#future-plans)**

Our future plans intend maintenance with Mintbase SDK, and VM. Additionally working with Mintbase to extend mintbase wallet functionality and add to gateways. We will also be adding more tutorials, NFT social features, and ways for developers to easily use this boilerplate adding additional UI kits.

* Work with mintbase to extend mintbase wallet functionality
* Build a meta transactions fund for subsidizing listing costs and progressive custody (in conjunction with [Onboard DAO](onboarddao.org) 
* Work with builders to integrate storefronts & custom use cases
* One click vercel click deployments for customizable mintbase gateway with BOS components
* We also have additional features in the ideating section of our [backlog](https://mintbase.genadrop.xyz/backlog)
* Build upon chain abstraction for multichain NFTs
