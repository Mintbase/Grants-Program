## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

A decentralized NFT gallery for artists does who aren't eligible to develop/handle a website for their NFTs or does artists who looking for a supportive platform for showing his art securely ...

### Overview

Social Media:

https://instagram.com/Digital.Collectible 
https://t.me/DigitalCollectible 

During the last 100 days from the start of the Digital Collectibles feature on Instagram, a huge number of artists, influencers, and companies were attracted to this amazing feature which is built into Matic Coin by default.
That is not an amazing experience (FOMO) but was the start of a journey.
We continuously posted content about those Digital collectibles over the last hundreds of days but still, something went wrong the artists don't know how to take part in this feature or show up their assets securely.

We had collected such wonderful data that might be interesting for u:
10~35% of those who reached out to us were looking for a marketplace and some where to mint their NFTs and show up that out of Instagram... (maybe the matic wasn't the best choice or they need a better way to show their art)

Now we are here to implement MintBase NFTs into a website as a decentralized gallery.
Artists will be eligible to show up their assets through an SEO-friendly website and put their custom-generated gallery domain proudly anywhere they want. (Social media, blogs, etc)

This system will generate unique subdomains like user1.example.com and will show their NFT assets in a beautiful interface to the visitor's freely.

So the Artists and their followers will be redirected to DigitalCollectible website and Mintbase instead of the other NFT marketplaces.


Our short range strategy based on four purpose:
1. Decreasing the costs to as low as possible in the start of project
2. Using the our artists help for website grow.
3. Increasing content engagement.
4. Creating a money circulation with Mint Base for covering advertisement cost.

In the long range the DC strategy will be reversed:
1. Using the website authority for making new artists bold and helping them to increase their impression.
2. Stabilizing the achievements (SEO, Social media growth, and number of active artists).

And the finally, 
how do we found MintBase?
My friends in Near coin forum redirect me to Mint Base as the best NFT marketplace in Near Ecosystems.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
This is a tough question for preseed project.
We can say that DigitallCollectible will be a bridge between Artists and their audience with an NFT marketplace wich we partnered with it.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Artists, and every body who working on NFTs.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
The main important need of this project is a NFT marketplace to be partnered with it.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
There is nothing like that in near ecosystem and in the world but theres similarity between DigitalCollectible and crew3.xyz just in subdomain section.

## Development Status :open_book:
The projects is in preseed and only templates developed till now.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in USN, and potentially NEAR and nUSDC, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
