## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

A decentralized NFT gallery for artists does who aren't eligible to develop/handle a website for their NFTs or does artists who looking for a supportive platform for showing their art securely ...

### Overview

Social Media:

https://instagram.com/Digital.Collectible 
https://t.me/DigitalCollectible 

During the last 100 days from the start of the Digital Collectibles feature on Instagram, a huge number of artists, influencers, and companies were attracted to this amazing feature which is built into Matic Coin by default.
That was not an amazing experience for me (FOMO) but was the start of a journey.
We continuously posted content about those Digital collectibles over the last hundreds of days but still, something went wrong the artists don't know how to take part in this feature or show up their assets securely.

We had collected such wonderful data that might be interesting for u:
10~35% of those who reached out to us were looking for a marketplace and some where to mint their NFTs and show up that out of Instagram... (maybe the matic wasn't the best choice or they need a better way to show their art)

Now we are here to implement MintBase NFTs into a website as a decentralized gallery.
Artists will be eligible to show up their assets through an SEO-friendly website and put their custom-generated gallery domain proudly anywhere they want. (Social media, blogs, etc)

This system will generate unique subdomains like user1.example.com and will show their NFT assets in a beautiful interface to the visitor's freely.

So the Artists and their followers will be redirected to DigitalCollectible website and Mintbase instead of the other NFT marketplaces.


Our short range strategy based on four purpose:
1. Decreasing the costs to as low as possible in the start of project
2. Using the our artists help for website grow.
3. Increasing content engagement.
4. Creating a money circulation with MintBase for covering advertisement cost.

In the long range the DC strategy will be reversed:
1. Using the website authority for making new artists bold and helping them to increase their impression.
2. Stabilizing the achievements (SEO, Social media growth, and number of active artists).

And the finally, 
how do we found MintBase?
My friends in Near coin forum redirect me to Mint Base as the best NFT marketplace in Near Ecosystems.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
This is a tough question for preseed project.
We can say that DigitallCollectible will be a bridge between Artists and their audience with an NFT marketplace wich we partnered with it.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Artists, and every body who working on NFTs.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
The main important need of this project is a NFT marketplace to be partnered with it.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
There is nothing like that in near ecosystem and in the world but theres similarity between DigitalCollectible and crew3.xyz just in subdomain section.
