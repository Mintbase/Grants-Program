# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** FundMeUP
- **Team Name:** FundMeUP
- **Payment Address:** 46eb11219cc50d871dcbe2dbcaab700550053927bb95f3f185527752f13f7df6
- **Level** 2

### Overview

## “Seamless Web3 crowdfunding - Secured by contract. Built with NEAR”

FundMeUP seeks to be the predominant NEAR crowdfunding platform in the NEAR ecosystem. With our smart contract based escrow funding platform, we seek to offer end users a funding platform that not only allows them to reach their funding goals, but leverages wizard driven assistance to formulate and maintain active campaigns to reach those goals. While other funding SAAS platforms tend to obfuscate the specific means of fundraising, our ultimate goal is to both educate and optimize campaign integration as an optional value add to the platform. This means our vision of assistance doesn't end with a simple listing. Our *GoalConnect* marketplace will allow revenue sharing with those who have the means to fullfill the fundraising goals.

We believe we can use a combination of internal smart contracts and the MINTBASE API to achieve our objectives to create a unique end user experience that will set us apart from other funding platforms. 

We believe that low transaction fees, the rapidly growing NEAR development community, the advent of the recent JAVASCRIPT SDK, and instant transaction in the NEAR ecosystem can create a superior experience to other crowd funding platforms that utilize conventional technology (or other blockchains). This helps to keep the money in the pockets of those who need it most. 

Members of our team understand how difficult running a small business can be. With the impact of COVID-19 decimating small businesses across the globe, we are passionate about providing those in need with the resources they require to be successful, and providing them with innovative tools to reach their funding goals.

- In the NEAR future, our project will NOT:
  - Mess around with cross chain functionality outside of NEAR ecosystem. We believe this will provide focus for the project. 
  - Perform Conversion into FIAT or perform cross chain mutations of funds. 
  - Perform Loans or Lines of Credit given Gary Genzler's recent comments on that industry. 
  - Attempt to create equity via a token sale or token distribution as a core aspect of the project (not extending to the potential for a DAO or treasury, the concerns of which may ultimately be considered a distinct undertaking). 

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - Target Audience: 
    - phase 1) Those seeking funding in relationship to Disaster Relief, Small Business & Startups,  Environmental Impact, Justice & Equality, and Wellness Aid (Humans or Pets),
    - phase 2) Fundraisers, campaign managers, and marketers who possess the strategies, relationships, and means to bring campaigns to fulfillment, and who can optionally revenue share as a contingency of campaign fulfillment. 
  - What need(s) does your project meet?
    - While our project aims to serve the needs of anyone who would benefit from a low transaction fee crowd funding platform, we aim to go beyond that. With only a small percentage of fundraising listings being met on mainstream *GoFundMe* (the focus of which is transaction mechanism, rather than a fulfillment platform), the long term vision of the *GoalConnect marketplace* will focus on contingency based fulfillment. In theory this creates a symbiotic relationship between those with specific needs, those who are willing to fund those needs, and those who can *connect the dots*.
  - How does this relate to Mintbase? 
    - FundMeUp will use two primary funding flows. We intend to use the Mintbase API for the partitioned funding flow (see partitioned funding flow [here](https://whimsical.com/fundmenear-3MB9GuL4FzvktZTeumUCDZ)). This is mutually adventagous as this flow will provide a double listing on both platforms for our end users. 
  - How does this relate to NEAR?
    - While price points may be correlated at the time of attribution for reference, all transcations on the platform will take place in NEAR. We are aware that price fluctuations may affect funding goals, which will simply be a reality of the platform for the Progressive flow that requires escrow over a fundraising period. As the organiztion grows it is possible that some form of *insurance* may become relevant against these fluctuations.       
  - Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
    - While there are several decentralized fundraising platforms, we have yet to encounter any that follow our go to market strategy, and none that appear to be noteworthy on the NEAR ecosystem. 
    - The nearest competitor using conventional technology is the GoFundME megacorp.

## Development Status :open_book:

- The 5 pillars of FundMeUP crowdfund market segments upon which FundMeUP will Focus
  - Wellness Aid (Humans or Pets)
    - Medically-related GoFoundMe campaigns raised a total of over $2 billion from around 21.7 million donations over the course of five years. 
      - https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/02/05/most-gofundme-campaigns-for-medical-bills-fail-less-than-12-reach-goals/?sh=2fe1eeda3f69
    - GoFundME Campaigns raised more than $2 billion from 21.7 million donations between 2016 and 2020. Returns were highly unequal, and success was low, especially in 2020: only 12% of campaigns met their goals, and 16% received no donations at all. Campaigns in 2020 raised substantially less money in areas with more medical debt, higher uninsurance rates, and lower incomes. 
      - https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306617
  - Disaster Relief
    - Victims of events like Hurricane Harvey have traditionally relied on organizations such as the Red Cross, working in tandem with the government, to deliver aid in the form of food, water, and emergency shelter in the wake of disasters. And when it comes time to rebuild their lives, they have looked to insurance, FEMA, and other programs for assistance. The relief, in other words, is standardized, and often comes attached to a mountain of paperwork. 
      - https://www.fastcompany.com/40490985/how-gofundme-is-redefining-the-business-of-disaster-relief
    - In the two months following Hurricane Harvey, GoFundMe and its sister site, CrowdRise, managed to funnel $65 million to victims and charities. (The Red Cross, by way of comparison, authorized $190 million in direct financial assistance over roughly the same time frame.) Millions more have been raised through hundreds of GoFundMe campaigns for people affected by Hurricane Maria, and the site is home to dozens of campaigns focused on rebuilding efforts in the Caribbean and Florida after Hurricane Irma tore through in early September. 
      - https://www.fastcompany.com/40490985/how-gofundme-is-redefining-the-business-of-disaster-relief
    - Approximately 30 percent of U.S. households made a disasterrelated donation in 2017 (31 percent) and in 2018 (29 percent). 
      - https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/19403/disaster-giving190521.pdf
  - Small Business & Startups 
    - According to the US Chamber of Commerce, 43% of small businesses surveyed believe that they have less than six months until a permanent shutdown is unavoidable 
    - https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/special-report-coronavirus-and-small-business
      - https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/covid19-financial-impact-on-black-businesses/
    - While mom and pop might not always be in focus, collectively small businesses are a powerful and influential piece of the economy. In fact, 99.9% of all businesses in the U.S. qualify as small businesses, collectively employing almost half (47.3%) of the nation’s private workforce.  - https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/05/america-united-states-covid-small-businesses-economics/
    - So, has the situation improved since the last time we examined this data? The short answer is no—on a national scale, 34% of small businesses are closed compared to January 2020. 
      - https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/05/america-united-states-covid-small-businesses-economics/
  - Environmental Impact 
  - Justice and Equality
    - Between February and April of 2020, Black business ownership declined more than 40%, the largest drop across any ethnic group, according to a report by the House Committee on Small Business Committee. The report details the impact Covid-19 has had on Black-owned businesses in the United States. Black-owned businesses were less likely to handle mandated closures due to lack of access to financial relief. 


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
