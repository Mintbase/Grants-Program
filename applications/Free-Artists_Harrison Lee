## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

We're building a fan financing platform (freeartists.xyz); where fans can contribute & participate in the upside of the full revenue of a creator. 

Free-Artists is a P2P creator financing platform initially focused on creating better financial deals for creators (i.e.music artists). The traditional label model/system suffers from a lack of transparency, and often features bad economics (90/10 revenue splits in favor of record labels). In these deals, artists often lose control of their projects.
Free-Artists will allow creators to raise capital directly from their fans in exchange for revenue rights. This puts artists in control of their contracts, enabling more fair economics and full autonomy. Our protocol is built on the blockchain, which at scale will allow it to run as a community-owned and fully transparent public utility.
Our core team has hyper-relevant experience: finance, music and Web3 infrastructure. We also have a deep network of innovative artists and industry professionals rooting for us to build this for them. Free-Artists is not a self-referential DeFi project like many are today–it coordinates capital on-chain, deploys it off-chain into the real world and then brings the resultant value back on-chain.

After launching the smart contract (for revenue distribution) on Aurora testnet last week (and mainnet this coming week), we're planning to build an automated proposal build & the ability to share updates.
We'd love to explore using permanent web storages with Mintbase for transparency & the ability to present personalized recommendations for backers & creators.
Proper tracking & cleaning of this data is crucial to build out recommendations, which is why we're excited to build with you.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Building out a kyc/social media implementation using mintbase+arweave as storage -> in the future could even provide a way for artists to update their profiles w/ data -> uploading videos, music, pdfs (fleshed out investment proposals), etc.
- Target Audience - creators (working with DAOs, NFT distribution platforms, etc.)
- Existing Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem platforms are NFT distribution (monetization focused); whereas Free-Artists is financing projects pre-value creation.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- after speaking with Paul K at length, the permanent web storage is a great option for Free-Artists to store relevant data & use to present tailored recommendations.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

For each milestone,

- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).
