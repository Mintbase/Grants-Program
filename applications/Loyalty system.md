## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
CoinPipe's NFT based loyalty system 
- A brief description of your project.
CP Loyalty system is a service for managing NFT based loalty programms for small and middle size businesses. 
Direct use case: the owner of the business wants to run loyalty system for its customers and at this point the owner of the business goes to CoinPipe's loyalty system, generates NFT's through MintBase and sends to the customers. The customers during the purchase are burning or showing their NFT's and getting royalties.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.
1. All the NFT's woud be run on MintBase
2. The amount of art works would be increased by the potential possibility to be used as a loyalty  NFT's and possibility to be bought by the owners of the businesses. 
3. We would increase recognition of MintBase by promoting MintBase as a minting platform and a marketplace
4. We would increase the number of NEAR wallet users and the NEAR token turnover value, cause the users would need to top up the wallet to burn NFT's 
5. The loyalty system would show to bigger corporation how the NFT's could be used in a real life and this might make them to make a step to cooperate with NFT as a technology. And the contact going in this case would be MintBase

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
We are working in the NEAR ecosystem more than 1.5 years and have created several projects as https://roke.biz, https://roke.to and https://coinpipe.finance.
We have a stable team of developers who really believe in NEAR blockchain and ecosystem. We've been on NEARCON with our beer truck and everybody on the event was able to buy beer and pay with NEAR. Probably they might be able to burn NFT's for the beer üòç.
so here are dry facts:
1. We think that loyalty systems now are pain in the ass (sorry)
2. They are always incomfortanble and you always need to store the paper or plastic cards (bad for the ecology)
3. People dont have any possibilities to use their loyalties somewhere else. With NFT you always have a various use cases
4. We know directly one of the owners of the business (14 bakeries in Austria), who would like to take this as a pilot project and we want to make it real.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N8_Yd7KwrWYIVyKbZbUVL19ZbDI0HAFm/view?usp=share_link 
Here are two screens explaining high level user flow and NFT management through loyalty campaigns. 
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
The main business models are User and Organization
The project also contains 3 endpoints:
 - POST /api/v1/users (create a user)
- POST /api/v1/tokens (to get a JWT token)
- POST /api/v1/organization (create an organization)
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Golang as a simple, fast and reliable language which used a lot for blockchain projects and is designed to be used as a bullet proof server language. 
- Libraries: chi router, go-validator, sqlx, jwt
- Database: postgres
- Docker to containerize the app and deploy to the cloud.
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
The architecture of the project as simple as possible. The choice has been made to the direction of simplicity. 
The project consists of main.go which is the entry point, handlers which handles incoming http requests and db service.
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
As a proof of concept would be taken an app where our user can mint NFTs through the MintBase and then organize promo loyalty companies for its customers, sending NFTs to the loyal customers.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ‚âà 1 month.


For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term
We are in a really close relationships with http://www.baeckereibauer.at Bakery chain in Austria. There are 14 shops where we would test out our loyalty system. 
We already have a business commitments that we would put our loyalty system in use at the moment when it will be ready.
So the plan is to develop loyalty system and test in a real environment. Then we plan to figure out some changes and bugs and go to bigger market, attract companies and do promo companies.
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.
We plan to develop a platform where NFT creators would be able to find a different ways to use their NFT‚Äôs with a help of small and medium size businesses. 
So the art creators would create and sell NFT‚Äôs, the business would buy them and use as a loyalty cards, tickets to the museums, concerts (etc) and the MintBase would be a basement for this bigger use case. CoinPipe would provide a working environment for the businesses to manage their assets to release their promo campaigns
