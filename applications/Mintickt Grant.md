## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

_Mintickt is an NFT ticketing platform that allows anyone to create events and sell their tickets as unique NFTs. The unique features of Mintickt are on the one hand the marketplace for creators, who offer their own ticket designs and hence get a share of the sales through royalties. But also the social aspects, which will be integrated into the event pages like the liking feature and commenting on events. With this, we want to promote interaction and connect people who attend the same event._

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- **If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one sentence summary):** A ticketing platform that utilizes NFT technology on the NEAR Blockchain.
- **A brief description of your project.** Mintickt v2.0 is the further development of Mintickt v1.0, which we recently launched on the NEAR Blockchain. With version 2.0, we enable many new features such as lazy minting, social interaction, sharing events, user profiles, and much more.
- **An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.** Our marketplace is built on the NEAR Blockchain and uses the Mintbase SDK for ticket minting.
- **An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.** Many of us surely know this, you go on a date to the cinema and because it was so nice you keep the ticket because you want to hold on to those memories. Unfortunately, physical tickets are hard to store and easy to lose. Another reason is the black market that is driven with festival and concert tickets, where the prices shoot on horrendous heights and "normal" people can no longer get tickets. We want to solve these two problems with blockchain technology, that is, to make events forever memorable on the blockchain and to make ticket sales as secure as possible for the end consumer.

### Project Details

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- **Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?:** We are developing an NFT ticketing platform that will allow anyone to create their own event page and sell their tickets as NFTs on the NEAR Blockchain.

- **Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?:** Mintickt is aimed at both B2C and B2B users who create events. However, since we also want to build a creator community that creates unique ticket designs, we also want to target NFT artists who can offer their ticket design on Mintickt as a template.

- **What need(s) does your project meet?:** It is primarily about ticketing, so we are targeting the ticketing industry, and secondary about creative art. This can be in the event, sports but also entertainment sectors.

- **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?:** On NEAR there is Seatlab and Backstage

  - **If so, how is your project different?:** Mintickt is a social and creative ticketing platform where we showcase great ticket art and where people have the opportunity to interact with the event like they do on Facebook events. 

  - **If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems:?** Seatlabd and Backstage.

### Team's experience

Please describe the team's relevant experience. If your project involves development work, we would appreciate it if you singled out a few interesting projects or contributions made by team members in the past. For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful.

- Guille is a passionate musician and serial entrepreneur in the music industry. He has developed a 100% independent digital music distributor (Zndrke, 2016), a tool that detects who is using your beats on digital platforms (Beat Lock, 2022), and a mobile app (which still in development) that lets you buy/sell beats, send beats to featured artists to close collaborations securely from your phone, and another platform which allows you to distribute your music on digital platforms (Flowtheapp, 2020). In all his projects, Guille is involved in all processes up to software development, but this has not limited him in team leadership. Guille is particularly comfortable in UI/UX design and product development, which is also where he has the most experience.

- Kemal is a serial entrepreneur with 15 years of experience in branding & marketing, business development, community building, and event management. He has a great passion for electronic music and with his label begood, he has organized several events himself and knows what's missing in the ticketing industry. In addition, he has built the largest electronic music community in the German-speaking world and thus receives direct feedback from people who regularly buy tickets or go to events. Kemal has also worked with the NEAR Foundation for over a year and is very well-versed in the NEAR ecosystem and technology. 

If anyone on your team has applied for a grant at the Web3 Foundation previously, please list the name of the project and legal entity here.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
    - Kemal has already been actively running BD and building some potential partnerships. These range from art events to conferences. The goal here is to gain initial experience with events and use this as a reputation to bring larger events on board.
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.
    - In the long term, we want to launch various marketing campaigns on the most popular social media channels to attract more users to our platform. Furthermore, we would like to collaborate with well-known NFT artists to bring more creatives to our platform. However, our biggest goal is to convert Web2 users to Web3 and for this, we will work with festivals from the music industry, as a large part of them have not yet had any contact with Web3.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Web3 Foundation Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- Work you have already done.
    - We have already built Mintickt v1.0 with an MVP grant from the NEAR Foundation. However, Mintickt v1.0 is very limited in its features and therefore unsuitable for larger events, so we aim to further develop our platform and launch v2.0.
- If there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project.
    - There were no other financial contributors
- Previous grants you may have applied for.
    - NEAR Foundation MVP Grant, which was $15,000 in $NEAR tokens.
