- **Team Name:** Benef√≠cio.web3
- **Payment Address:** obeneficio.near
- **Level:** 2 (up to 50k)

## Project Overview

### PWX - Portuguese Whisky Exchange
> Blending Craftmanship (as a form of art) to a mixed reality ecossystem

#### What is Portuguese Whisky Exchange
Craftmanship (as a form of art) has never really been connected to the internet. Web3 changes that. Now, our artists - the Blenders - can digitize their art (and ownership of it) and connect to a global market.

Our Portuguese Whisky Exchange eliminates the need for ‚Äútrust‚Äù and the need for intermediaries facilitating virtual transactions. Instead, safe transactions and reliable payments are guaranteed through the blockchain and on our website.

Those with local interest in distilleries, previously unable to access these casks, will be able to join the wave of the growing popularity of new world whisky and be ahead of the game with what looks to be the future of premium single malt.

#### How it works

##### THE INITIAL CASK OFFER (ICO)
We unlock the value of the cask via an NFT. With your NFT ICO you have exclusive access to the first-hand purchase of Initial Cask Offer (ICO) of the Portuguese Whisky Exchange.

##### THE TERMS - NFT ICO

25 NFTs with multiple service and product layers (Options). The Initial Cask Offer (ICO) includes the purchase of a Rare Portuguese Whisky Cask and possible future appreciation, in levels of 3 years, 5 years, 8 years and 12 years at most.

##### ICO FLOOR PRICE

Initial Cask Offer ‚Äì NFT PWX ICO:
$6500 = 1300 NEAR = 1 uCask*
*uCask: PWX Token

##### THE BUYING FLOW

1. Login with your NEAR wallet;
2. Acquire at least 1300 NEAR Tokens;
3. Exchange 1300 NEAR into one uCask and trade it for PWX NFT ($6500).

##### BUYING OPTIONS

- **NFT+ (OPTIONS)**: The rationale behind this concept it is to build a platform that generates NFTs, with associated benefits that are twofold, backed by real life, that you can convert into physical goods, but also into a digital option that gives you access to a certain point in the road map.

- **NFT + (OPTIONS FLOW)**: One way to unlock the value of this new market is to allow the client with flexibility, to either commit now to the Whisky and commit later. We envision an NFT tied to a purchase option (like options in the stock market), where the client can grow into the asset.

- **Experience + Options**: The NFT will be a two layered system allowing access to a physical experience, working as a ticket, and to a fixed amount of uCasks/bottles at different points in the roadmap. The value: the customer gets access to an experience and has the potential to lock in a value whisky purchase down the line. Great for beginners and occasional amateurs.

- **Experience + Whisky + Options**: The customer gets access to the experience, a fixed amount of bottles at the end of the process, and the possibility to acquire more bottles at a discount price. In an ideal market, acquiring whiskey and options, can allow a client to actually have a significant ROI, at still have some bottles for himself at the end of the process.

#### Relation to the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem:

We are currently evaluating the best conceptual and architectural solutions that enable the following cases:

- NFTs as gatekeepers to real world experiences
    - How to generate and burn access credentials (e.g. NFTs as tickets)
    - How to unlock real world content levels with NFTs

- How to use NFTs in a binding contract
  - We generate uCasks that translate to cask ownership
  - NFTs translate into real world exeriences associated with ownership
  - NFTs translate into buying options (equivalent to stock futures)
  - The contract issuer (PWX) should provide a smart contract that reserves uCask for future purchase, and will require the NFT holder (the contract signer) to unlock those tokens paying the agreed upon fee

The Portuguese Whisky Exchange integrates two contract factories in the NEAR ecosystem. The first is the Mintbase minting contract, which manages the list of co-op members as minter wallets authorized in the contract.

The second contract in the toolkit is our custom distribution contract. Whenever funds are sent to this distribution contract, it queries the list of minters from the Mintbase contract and proceeds to distribute the product ownership to each of the buyers of the cask and options.


#### Why Portuguese Whisky Exchange?

> PORTUGUESE WHISKY EXCHANGE -  Backed by Real Life

##### LAUNCHING A RARE PORTUGUESE WHISKY CASK
Our Rare Portuguese Whisky Cask is an example of the finest craftsmanship, cooperage and wood management. This Malt Whisky is distilled by the finest people, the best lots of barleyand refined by our Terroir. The ideal whisky maturation climate, pure limestone water, exclusive range of wood, toasts, and seasoned by the finest of wines, is the perfect invitation to explore each cask‚Äôs unique characteristics.

When it comes to the flavor profile of The Rare Portuguese Whisky Cask, the Maturation program may contribute up to 80% of the flavor and to 100% of its color, it‚Äôs both magic and science and we believe that blending these two is an art.

##### UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITIONS (USP‚ÄôS):
1. Rare Portuguese Whisky;
2. Scarcity;
3. Careful and meticulous choice of wood used in the casks;
4. Quality of the aging process;
5. Perfect whisky maturation climate.

### Project Details

#### Portuguese Whisky Exchange __Tokenomics__
1. Portuguese Whisky Cask (NFT);
2. Potential for Appreciation ‚Äì potential for appreciation over time in rare whiskey markets;
3. Transaction Fee ‚Äì 5%;
4. Percentage (%) rewards (APR) from DeFi protocols staking and liquidity pools;
5. Advice/Concierge Service ‚Äì help and support service for the set-up and acquisition of NFTs;
6. Related Services - multiplication of NFTs as a service/product;

Vesting period ‚Äì time token can‚Äôt be sold by the buyer ‚Äì Three years and one day, in this period,
if you need to sell your NFT, a 25% sale penalty will be applied, plus a 5% transaction fee. After
this period (3 years and 1 day) only the transaction fee will be applied.

####  What Portuguese Whisky Exchange Is Not:

We are not a platform that you apply to join as an individual artist or NFT producer, we are a Marketplace for Producers and Consumers of Portuguese Whisky.

### Ecosystem Fit

#### Where and how does Portugues Whisky Exchange fit into the ecosystem?

Since we have started working on the NFT space we found out that Mintbase‚Äôs artists and users joined the space for the facility of the user experience.

The capability for multiple royalty and revenue splits, native to both NEAR NFT standard and Mintbase minting contracts, is one of the features that proved to be key to mass adoption.

Building an offer a feature that could be adding and removing of authorized minter wallets, to expand revenue and bring more users to the contracts will be an key to increase the potencial of the project.

Our NFT Options mechanism could be an excelent feature for Mintbase growth.

#### Who is Portuguese Whisky Exchange for?

*THE WHISKY CASK MARKET*

Whilst maturing whisky casks have gained momentum as a high performing asset due to their impressive returns, investment is just one of the reasons many opt for cask ownership:

1. As an investment;
2. For special events & occasions;
3. Buy for a child‚Äôs birth, keep for a wedding or special event;
4. To create your own whisky brand;
5. To add to a collection;
6. As a cultural link;
7. Adding something unusual to an existing whisky cask portfolio;
8. Early adoption.


#### What need(s) does Portuguese Whisky Exchange meet?

Craftmanship (as a form of art) has never really been connected to the internet. Web3 changes that. Now, our artists - the Blenders - can digitize their art (and ownership of it) and connect to a global market.

#### Are there any other projects similar to Portuguese Whisky Exchnge in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?

We are not aware of any project similar to Portuguese Whisky Exchange in the Mintbase / Near ecosystem.

#### Paulo Fernandes
I fought with Greeks and Romans, when I thought I should rest from those battles I traveled to Lisbon. I entered the world of the arts and that was the first step to realize the importance of details, artistic delicacy and beauty. For me, both in perfection and in imperfection, there is beauty and together they make any piece unique.
I have worked in the design, branding, marketing and communication world for over 20 years. Today I do what I love most at Benef√≠cio, architecture and product development.

#### Alfredo Matos
Developer, PhD, and computer scientist. Successfully failed a startup, built a software agency and moved into consultancy providing CTO services. I've built and launch projects for my companies and for my clients. Now I just want to build meaningful software that genuinely helps and unlocks real-life value, so that I can tell my kids that I've left this world better than it was when I got here.

## Development Status :open_book:

Actual development roadmap will be defined in the coming weeks, depending on the conditions defined in the development status. Once the business roadmap is closed and the technology architecture is defined, we should be ready to implement a service that provides to major componentes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

1) Binding contracts that allow purchasing Token futures based on the ownership of an NFT
    a) Buy the NFT (the smart contract activation fee)
    b) Establish the smart contract between the NFT holder and the Token holder

2) Using NFTs with a ticket validation system
    a) Ticket generator: issue NFTs with cryptographic properties for ticken validation, with a visual component, as well as a cryptographic component that power the ticket validation
    b) Ticket validator: as an NFT burner, for access

These two components, are the main deliverables that will be considered, either one, both, or subsets of the functionality that allow us to reach an MVP as soon as possible. While we have no verifiable software development milestones at this point, we are working hard on closing our business loops so that the actual software architecture and developement roadmap becomes clear ASAP.
