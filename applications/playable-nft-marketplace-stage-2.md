## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
The AILAND Playable NFT Marketplace is an advanced integration of our existing marketplace with new, innovative features. We propose to develop two key user interfaces: the 'Sell UI' for listing NFT skins and the 'Chest UI' for opening chests containing random loot (skins), enhancing the user experience in our AILAND gaming ecosystem.

### Project Details

Building on our successful core marketplace, we will create intuitive and engaging UIs, ensuring a seamless experience for our users. The 'Sell UI' will allow players to list and trade their unique NFT skins, providing a platform for economic interaction. The 'Chest UI' will introduce an exciting element where players can obtain random loot, enhancing their in-game assets and overall experience.

Technologically, we plan to utilize modern frameworks and languages such as React for frontend development, integrated with our existing smart contract infrastructure on NEAR. Our focus is on creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces that align with the immersive nature of AILAND.

### Ecosystem Fit

AILAND's new features aim to enrich the NEAR ecosystem by providing innovative ways for users to engage with NFTs. This development aligns with the growing interest in blockchain gaming and NFT utilization, setting a standard for future NFT-based gaming platforms.
