# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** DAOsign
- **Team Name:** DAOsign
- **Payment Address:** 0x793F7a7542c14088dbF58A19d2687FB9E7A79482
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 3

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

DAOsign is a decentralized platform for agreements and automated workflows, with publicly verifiable, cryptographic proofs-of-signature, designed for DAOs and WEB3 companies.
Verifiable Signature is at the core of DAOsign and is based on 3 key proofs: proof-of-identify, proof-of-authority, and proof-of-agreement. Utilizing these proofs, DAOsign provides a platform to design and configure complex workflows that combine smart-contract-based automation with authorized approvals.

Our project seeks to enhance the Mintbase and NEAR ecosystem by providing an agreement-signing tool that empowers users to securely execute and manage agreements related to their NFT transactions. Through this integration, we aim to streamline processes, enhance user experience, and contribute to the growth and adoption of both Mintbase and NEAR.

We were solving the problem for ourselves. Before DAOsign, our team was working as a blockchain consulting agency and we regularly had clients who didn't want to disclose their identities, so we were not able to sign any kind of legal agreements with them. Neither DocuSign nor other known solutions back to that time didn't help us to solve this problem.
And after we wrote down our idea in detail and shared it with our clients, friends and partners, we got very positive feedback and realized that it was not only us who were in such a situation.

### Project Details

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic: [One-pager](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDWNBoz18y11kARGxZpQrN_ca2muDmT7/view?usp=sharing)
We would like to have a screening call with you and demo DAOsign, if appropriate

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project plays a critical role within the Mintbase ecosystem by providing an agreement-signing tool for Mintbase users. It serves as an essential layer that enhances the transactional and contractual aspects of the NFT marketplace. By integrating our tool with Mintbase, users gain access to a streamlined and secure process for executing and managing agreements related to their NFT transactions.

DAOsign has a user-friendly interface and is suitable for almost all users of the web3 industry with different purposes.

The primary need that our project meets is the requirement for trust, transparency, and security in NFT transactions within Mintbase. With the increasing popularity of NFTs, it is crucial to have a robust system in place to handle the contractual aspects of these transactions. DAOsign addresses this need by providing a reliable and user-friendly solution for Mintbase users to create, sign, and manage agreements.

We have two categories of competitors: legacy electronic signature tools such as DocuSign and web3 signature tools such as ethsign.xyz. We made some research and a more detailed competitive landscape can be found in our pitch deck.
