# Mintbase Grant Proposal

**Project Name:** "Ancestors NFTs Marketplace"

**Team Name:** Blocks Labs 

**Payment Address**: pulsarforge.near

**Level:** 1


## Project Overview 

**A tag line:** NFTs Marketplace, create the ancestors, tree of life, and the evolutions.

**Project description:**
Ancestors, NFTs Marketplace, based on ai image generators, custom models trained, Mintbase tech stack, tree of life.

Vision: World building.

The proposal:

Leverage ai pre trained image generator models for the creator and nfts economy, this itself create a common playground of art for the creators to interact, compare and talk.

Additionally train custom models based on handcrafted art, putting the tech at the service of graphic creators.

**Goal:**
- Enable easy onboarding for users.
- World building, their ancestors tree of life.
- Leverage current techs to the advantage of the creators and creative teams.

## Project Details
Using current ai image generator trained models, as "stylized anime creatures" and similar trained models for characters, with those models available, creators write their prompts and/or add an image of reference, thus creating a tree of life and deciding its evolution, their Ancestors timeline, like a gallery.

These are assets ideals for create NFTs collections, first generation, second generation. 

Train custom image generators models, Why? since the rise of this type of technology, graphic artist can use this tech to their advantage, How? Creating art, 10, 20, 30 pieces in a consistent style, to train ai models, thus artist, access to a position of art directors, style creators, there advantages as part of their time could be used to enable additonal features in their collections.

It is also important to highlight those artist that consistenly create art, independently of market conditions, a featured "Marathon Creators", as well as other categories, as "Big Trees" those collection created by teams or with special features.

**Technology stack:**
- Cloudflare ( Infrastructure, APIs integrations and management, if needed a database integration, micro front-ends, deployments )
- APIs from Image Generators, ( Examples: leonardo ai, scenario, already tested the services, features, current use cases )
- React.
- An IPFS solution, ( to storage the nfts )
- Mintbase tech stack.
- NEAR CLI.
- NEAR Javascript.
- Discord, twitter, forms ( to enable ways to get and receive feedback )
- Python data science notebooks, embedable charts, to track real stats around topic of interest about the marketplace.
- Keypom Drops, It enables easy NEAR Protocol onboarding.
- Unlock protocol ( To enable web3 recurrent payments, subscriptions, compatible with several wallet and usual payment options, I have tested it with EVM networks)

### Future Plans:

Activities related to: 
- How to enhance the visibility of active creators / teams?
- How to enhance the interactions of the different trees of life, ancestors profiles, users, creators?
- Which integrations with Aurora, and/or NEAR smart contracts enhance the vision of the project?
- How to enhance the world building around the tree of life? Examples: 
  * Fantasy dashboards with biology, or body, stats, customizable or randoms.
  * Add options to add texts, or hashtags, at parts of the life tree.
  * Group, ungroup, elements of the tree of life.
- Which partnerships explore or set up?
- Which stats or facts are useful for the users and creators?
- Which use cases are cool to explore?
- Which use cases are waiting to be discovered?
