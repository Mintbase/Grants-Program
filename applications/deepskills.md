# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Deep Skills
- **Team Name:** Deep Skills Ltd
- **Payment Address:** kischiman.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- Deep Skills is automating contributor recruitment and decentralising project- and payroll management for DAOs and online-native cooperatives.
- The application allows contributors to create and complete collaborative projects, get paid, earn skill attestations and build up their professional reputation on-chain.
- At NEAR, Deep Skills will act as an extension to the proposal platform AstroDAO, helping DAOs coordinate. Mintbase will provide the infrastructure to issue on-chain credentials for completed projects and skills.
- Our team has been designing and building digital products for the web3 ecosystem for the last four years and simultaneously innovated on a way to organize as a freelancer collective. After working on over 50 different projects, we are excited to bring our innovative ways of working to other industries.### Project Details

- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality:
    - Core API specifications: [https://dsp-core.herokuapp.com/docs/](https://dsp-core.herokuapp.com/docs/)
    - Backend: [https://github.com/Deep-Skills/dsp-core](https://github.com/Deep-Skills/dsp-core)
    - Frontend: [https://github.com/Deep-Skills/dsp-web](https://github.com/Deep-Skills/dsp-web)
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
    - Languages:
        - Backend :
            - Node js (express framework)
        - Frontend:
            - React framework
            - Integration with Metamask + NEAR web wallet/ sender wallet: [https://senderwallet.io/](https://senderwallet.io/)
        - Ongoing work, which will be part of this project:
            - Mintbase, NEAR SDK for smart contract development
    - Database:
        - MongoDB
    - Backend and front-end hosting is on a cloud provider
    - Scaling:
        - Initial use of nodes/scaling solution provided by the cloud hosting providers first and consider specifically loadbalancer setup if/when it will be required.
    - CI/CD:
        - Front-end connected/integrated with Vercel pipeline at Gtihub
        - For backend we are considering Github actions (but proper set of unit and integration tests already in place and will be maintained continuously)
        - Moving forward we will add `near-smart-contracts` to the backend and frontend repos above.
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
    - For this project, we plan to integrate project payments on the NEAR blockchain and build a profile on decentralized storage. Portfolio and achievements will be stored on the Ceramic network and also be issued as Mintbase NFT badges upon completion of the project.
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
    - The current version of the app (without NEAR payment support) can be accessed here:
        - [https://dsp-web.vercel.app/](https://dsp-web.vercel.app/)
    - Our research is based on working with many web3 teams:
        - [https://deepwork.studio/case-studies](https://deepwork.studio/case-studies)
    - Part of the research comes from [Google’s Project Aristotle](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html), which explores how the most efficient teams collaborate.
    - We also refer to the research on [Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model for DAOs](https://medium.com/block-science/applying-stafford-beers-viable-system-model-to-decentralized-organization-ac42e17bf73) by our friends from Blockscience.
    - An off-chain version of a similar project by our team can be accessed here:
        - [https://app.deepskills.io/](https://app.deepskills.io/)
        - The design studio [Deep Work](https://deepwork.studio) has been operating on these principles for the last 3 years, using a combination of no-code tools rather than custom software.
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
    - The project does not (yet) include multisig or smart contracts which lock up funds. Instead, we are relying on UX patterns which don’t require custom contracts.
    - Deep Skills does not handle proposals or governance.
    - Deep Skills’ UX does not focus on one-off bounties or tasks. It also encourages collaborative work, rather than solitary work.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
    - At NEAR, Deep Skills will act as a job-board and extension to the proposal platform AstroDAO. DAOs can create proposals on AstroDAO, start tracking their collaborative projects on Deep Skills and the on-chain project attestations can be seen on [stats.gallery](http://stats.gallery) as part of each contributor’s profile. This connection is based on our conversations with Jordan from AstroDAO and Jacob from Stats.gallery
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
    - Existing DAOs on NEAR who need better oversight of the collaborative work and project teams who want to become DAOs by working together on a common goal.
    - On the other side, Deep Skills presents work opportunities for digital nomads in organizational roles and makes it easier to become part of a team.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
    - Most web3 projects have trouble coordinating and learning from their experience as a collective. Current tools to store projects and reputation are clunky or permissioned. Deep Skills helps teams hold each other accountable on collaborative projects, keep an on-chain record of their collaborative work and store the exact contribution of each individual.
    - The trust in CVs, job-board profiles, online course credentials is low due to easy falsification. By showing rich reputation profiles from actual projects (verified on-chain), Deep Skills makes it easier to trust claims about previous work, find skilled freelancers and discover skill-based work opportunities.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
    - If so, how is your project different?
        - AstroDAO is similar, but focuses on governance proposals and one-off bounties.
    - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
        - A tool that is often compared to Deep Skills is [dework.xyz](http://dework.xyz), which focuses on individual bounty-driven work and delegation of one-off tasks. 
        Deep Skills has been designed with a focus on collaboration - to help teams develop innovative collectives by holding each other accountable for the work.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2.5 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 3 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 50,000 USD

We are also happy to split the two milestones into two separate grant proposals if that approach is more favorable.

### Milestone 1 — Mint Mintbase NFTs when projects complete

- **Estimated duration:** 1.5 months
- **FTE:** 3
- **Costs:** 25,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0a. | License | ISC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains the functionality. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Video walkthrough | We will publish a video walkthrough that explains how to use Deep Skills on NEAR to create projects and mint Mintbase NFTs to issue attestations for project participation. 
| 1. | Research in Mintbase smart contracts, NEAR NFT standards, and Mintbase SDK and tooling. |  |
| 2. | Design userflow to login to Deep Skills with near wallet, participate and complete a project, issue NFTs upon completion. |  |
| 3. | Deploy Mintbase smart contracts to mint NFTs. |  |
| 4. | Mintbase implementation for our use case | Integrating user flow to issue a proof/certification NFT that would read the metadata from the Deep Skills app and mint NFTs upon project completion. |
| 5. | Frontend and UI updates | Frontend and UI to support the issuance of NFTs with a summary of each team member’s contribution. |

## Future Plans
- NEAR chain integration. As seen on the prototype, it will be possible to select NEAR payments on project creation and send payments in NEAR native tokens upon completion.
- Implement multisig for each project in order to automate payments
- Connect project data to AstroDAO and export to [Stats.gallery](http://Stats.gallery) on NEAR
