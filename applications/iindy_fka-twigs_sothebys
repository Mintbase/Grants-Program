### Overview

iiNDYVERSE is partnering with Sotheby’s and Grammy-nominated artist FKA twigs, who boasts 1.1 billion Spotify streams, to launch a limited NFT collection for viewers of a 14-day livestream for her new major album release, EUSEXUA. 

As this is mainly an artist funded project, we are seeking grant funding to enable them to afford  the digital collectibles component into the campaign.  We expect to offer up to 1m NFTs to viewers at a cost of $1 per collectible. 

**About iiNDYVERSE**

iiNDYVERSE is an interactive engagement platform that enables seamless gamified experiences and  NFT based rewards within instant messaging apps. Clients include Nike, Air Jordan, Pernod Ricard, Ray-Ban, and top artists from UMG, XL Recording, Atlantic Records.

Given over 90% of viewers will be non-crypto natives, we propose to enable fans to purchase and claim NFTs using a passwordless **one tap** wallet creation and digital asset minting via instant messaging apps (e.g. WhatsApp). This authentication process relies on multiple layers of security checks, such as one-time, time bound, JW tokens sent to verified WhatApp accounts,to ensure user data protection and fraud prevention, which are crucial for building trust with non-crypto native users.
We plan to use this grant to support integrating Mintbase stack into the iiNDYVERSE platform to supprt the web3 onboarding, minting and smart contract management. We will build this service to be production ready.

**Relevance to Mintbase and NEAR**

- Mintbase's APIs and the NEAR SDK will be used for all Web3 elements of the project
- Our passwordless, **one-tap** on ramp and airdrop approach has a 90% conversion rate, and will benefit Mintbase and NEAR driving the creation of up to 1 million new active wallets and digital assets in the NEAR ecosystem.
- NEAR smart contracts are used to handle the core fan rewards logic.
- This provides a great case study to drive awareness of NEAR and Mintbase because the project will be heavily promoted by the record label, the artist and Sotherby’s; and will be covered in many mainstream press outlets.

**Team's Motivation**

- The team is committed to mainstream adoption of web3 enabled experiences, and has been working with Brands and Music Artists since 2022, enabling seamless Web3 rewards within instant messaging apps to drive loyalty and engagement.
- We believe that frictionless (almost invisible) brand led user experiences is an essential feature to mainstream adoption and the interoperable nature of NFT based rewards will open up opportunities for brands to provide more utility and benefits to their customers and fans.
- We chose NEAR and Mintbase because we of our existing relationship from being an early adopter and grant beneficiary on the NEAR Foundation and interested in contributing with easy to use tooling and case studies geared towards showing how major brands and musicians can use NEAR and Mintbase stack in everyday marketing campaigns and commerce experiences.

### Project Details

- The current platform UI and one-tap end customer experience are covered in our demo and we have basic smart contracts deployed on testnet and mainnet. (links  below).

    - integrate with Shopify Headless framework to enable seamless eCommerce checkout experiences for Digital assets.
    - Release a production version to power the Sotheby’s x FKA twigs EUSEXUA Collectibles launch.
- Technology Stack:
    - Smart Contracts: Rust, NEAR SDK, Mintbase API
    - Front End: React,  Shopify Headless Frameworkm  Hydrogen (Remix / React),
    - Hosting: AWS, Shopify Oxygen
    - Interactive Comms stack - WhatsApp, Apple For Business, Twilio (SMS), MessageBird

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does our project fit into the ecosystem?**

- First, our project **allows people who would not typically engage with NFT-enabled Web3 activations to do so as scale**, by removing the upfront friction and complexity for both the marketer and the customer..
- Second, it benefits the **overall reputation and awareness  of the NEAR ecosystem within the wider market**, having a highly influential artist and brand collab powering their **NFT-enabled Web3 activation exclusively on NEAR / Mintbase.**
- In general, our solution  helps to **open the NFT economy and utilities to Brands, Creators and their fan bases who typically do not engage in Web3,** and may not even be aware of NEAR, thus ultimately boosting a new wave of adoption.

**Who is our target audience?**

- Top tier Artists and eCommerce and digital marketers at medium to large Consumer Brands  who want to offer interactive experiences and digital rewards to amplify new product releases and customer loyalty initiatives.
- Mainstream customers and fans who are value easy of use and fun over control and complexity.
    - Specifically for this project, we are direct targeting the 5.4M social media fans of FKA twigs, and the 4M social media fans of Sotheby’s.

**What need(s) does our project meet?**

- For Brands and Musicians, we provide them a customer friendly and secure way for them to use digital collectibles to earn new revenue and offer rewards to their most loyal fans. 
We ensure compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including tax implications and consumer protectio(n laws, which are clearly communicated to our users. See our GDPR Policy (https://iindyverse.notion.site/iiNDY-GDPR-Policy-eae1af40ddb94847ad27155a1ee5fd5a) and Privacy policy (https://www.iindyverse.com/privacy) for further details.
Our passwordless, one-tap approach is based on unique,time-bound, one-time authentication links sent to a verified whatsapp account. This approach also mitigages againt SMS OTP interception attacks. We also intend to add support for browser based biometrics/ passkeys as a 2nd factor to authourise wallet transactions.
 

- For fans who are interested in purchasing/owning limited collectibles , we offer them a simple way to purchase them and benefit from the utility/rewards it unlocks.
 Currently, trading and price speculation is not a requirment for our target customers, as the NFTs act more as a soul-bound loyalty mechanism. However, as Client and Fan needs evolve in the future, we will implement a feature allowing fans to trade or exchange their collectibles either on the platform or via existing marketplaces.

**Are there any other projects similar to ours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?**

- This project is specific and unique opportunity with a major Brand (Sothebys) and major Artists (FKA twigs). We are the exclusive tech partner on this project.
- More broadly, there are generic Web3 loyalty apps in the market, but we have not found a solution that seamless embeds on-tap web3 onramp and rewards into interactive messaging conversations.

## Future Plans

For the specific project, FKA twigs plans on offering a range of exclusive products and access to events to owners of the EUSEXUA collectibles. 

We expect the label, Atlantic Records, which has a roster that includes Lizzo, Bruno Mars, Charlie XCX, Ed Sheeran and Janelle Monae, is closely looking to this project as a case study for others on their roster who don’t have a core web3 audience.  

Also, when resources allow,  we plan to release a free to use mini/demo app and supporting github repo for other Brand marketers and creators in the NEAR/Mintbase ecosystem to engage with.  

Lastly, our team also plans to strike collaborations with brand x music x gaming studios, to further extend the utility of the collectibles to in-game experiences and the virtual goods economy.
