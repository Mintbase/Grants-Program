## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- **Tagline:** Decentralized Super-App for Digital Creators
- **Description:** Mintflick is a decentralized platform where creators can mint NFTs of pictures, blogs, videos, and polls. Creators can also livestream, host token-gated events, sell tickets, and create subscription-based plans for their superfans. Users can connect for voice-to-voice gatherings and host events with token-gated NFT ticket experiences for the audience. Currently developed on Solana, Mintflick aims to integrate with NEAR for a seamless multi-chain experience.
- **Integration:** Mintflick's integration with NEAR and Mintbase will provide creators and users a smooth, reliable, and secure platform that takes advantage of the NEAR ecosystem's benefits.
- **Interest:** Our team is passionate about empowering digital creators and believes that integrating NEAR will bring new opportunities and enhance the user experience on Mintflick.

### Project Details

Mintflick is already developed and has a user base of 1k+, which is growing. By integrating NEAR and leveraging Mintbase, we aim to expand our platform's capabilities and create a better experience for our users.

- **UI components:** Our UI components include a homepage, creator profiles, NFT galleries, and event listings. We also have a wallet integration and transaction history display.
- **Data models / API:** Core functionality includes NFT minting, token-gated events, subscriptions, and voice-to-voice gatherings. These features will be integrated with NEAR and Mintbase APIs.
- **Technology stack:** NextJs, Node.js, Solana, NEAR, and Mintbase.
- **Documentation:** We have comprehensive documentation on our platform's architecture, components, and protocols.
- **Prior work:** Mintflick is a fully functioning platform with 1k+ users and is developed on the Solana blockchain.

### Ecosystem Fit

Mintflick's integration with NEAR and Mintbase will empower digital creators, improve our platform's capabilities, and contribute to the growth of the NEAR ecosystem. Our target audience includes digital creators, NFT collectors, event organizers, and fans. Our project addresses the need for a comprehensive, decentralized platform for creators to monetize their work and engage with their audience.

There are other creator-focused platforms in the blockchain space; however, Mintflick's multi-chain integration, and extensive creator tools set us apart from the competition.
