# Jutsu Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Mintbase template development experience enhancement with Jutsu
- **Team Name:** Jutsu
- **Payment Address:** jutsuai.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 2

## Project Overview

### Overview

**Mintbase templates** are a compilation of web3 project examples on Near Protocol, providing developers with starter projects and practical use cases. Currently the number of templates are limited, as are the options for building and deployment, and there is a need for more community/developer involvement.

**Jutsu** is an AI powered developer platform where developers can leverage our WebIDE and Copilot to build any DApp 10X faster.

The purpose of this project is to build the best developer experience that will empower anyone to build and contribute to Mintbase templates.

Here are the steps (DEVX):

- Step 1: User can search for templates in Mintbase template library (https://templates.mintbase.xyz/) or in Jutsu template library (https://app.jutsu.ai/templates)

- Step 2: When user find a template they want to use the will click “Open in Jutsu” button in Mintbase template library.

- Step 3: The user will get a “clone” of the template in their Jutsu account. They will be able to build and deploy their DApp from within Jutsu.

- Step 4: User will be able to deploy their DApp in IPFS, Arweave, and NEARFS using Web4

### Ecosystem Fit

Jutsu, with our AI powered Web3 IDE, slots perfectly into the Mintbase ecosystem, making it easier for developers and founders to use and deploy Mintbase templates. By incorporating Mintbase's extensive template library directly into Jutsu, we offer a dual advantage:

1. Users will be able to open Mintbase templates within the Jutsu platform, and begin building with full access to our comprehensive suite of developer tools.
2. Users will be able to take advantage of Jutsu’s advanced WebIDE features and tools, such as our copilot, code generation, debugging, doc generation, generative UI, and Google Docs-style collaboration for teams.

This strategic integration aims to provide Mintbase users with an effortless start and an enriched coding and deployment experience through Jutsu, ultimately elevating the developer experience within Mintbase, and the broader NEAR ecosystem.

Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
We are not aware of any similar projects in the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem.
