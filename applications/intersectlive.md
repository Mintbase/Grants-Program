- **Project Name:** **Intersect** - Art, Technology, Culture
- **Team Name:** **Intersect**
- **Payment Address:** 7281a9cd7b1bd287b968f002dc64a5fac14e87950e309a2f113a890021d610b4

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This is a standalone application.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
	- **Intersect** - Art, Technology, Culture
- A brief description of your project.
	- **Intersect** is a cross platform event series that brings internationally renowned artists and their communities together. Working with these global multi-hyphenated creators and underpinned by world class exhibitions/experiences, Intersect is an artist first programme providing a platform for new digital media, artists incubation and for fans to connect with their favourite artists.
	- Offering real world art events around the world, to digital art shows streamed online or even in the metaverse, creators can leverage Intersect's tools and platform to reach their audiences wherever they are, and realise the value of their works easily on one platform.
	- Intersect makes it easy for creators to connect and continue to build their communities, mint digital assets and issue ownership rights seamlessly.
	- To the public, Intersect is a friendly and relatable Web3 onboarding platform, lowering the barrier to experiencing and owning digital assets. Paving the way for great trust with Intersect and facilitating the long term growth of a Web3 future.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.
	- Intersect Marketplace uses Mintbase's DAO to mint all its digital asset NFTs ensuring a secure and safe platform for all users.We intend to propose new methods to extend the DAO to include some of our solutions listed below (e.g. Customer Due Diligence, Verifiable Wallet IDs, pre-checks, ownership checks, buyer checks).
	- Intersect DAO is a smart contract developed on NEAR protocol, a leading layer 1 public blockchain protocol, and is built using the NEAR SDK using RUST programming language. It is a DAO and is designed to run autonomously. All transactions are public and transparent and can be fully audited at any time by any interested members of the public. Adding to building long term confidence in users for the ecosystem.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
	- **Protecting NFT's Future**
		- NFT have helped solve the provenance of digital assets by logging origination, transaction history and wallet trail. It has helped provide a verifiable chain of custody with an auditable trail of transactions. However, this proof is limited to showing the transactions between wallets.
		- For creators like artists and musicians, the provenance of the NFT does not show any links to him/her (a person) and instead to a wallet id that cannot be verified that it belongs to him/her. Today, wallets are seen as disposable and ownership can be interchangeable.
			- **Identity** - NFT proves a digital trail of a series of wallets with no certainty its origination started with any owner (person or organisation).
			- **Centralisation** - It is highly centralised. For example, NFTs minted and sold through OpenSea depend on OpenSea's profile for identification. And with the rise of fake profiles and copycat NFTs, the model is proving to be unscalable and unmanageable.
			- **Anti-Money Laundering** - Digital assets are increasingly used to move large amounts of money beyond the reach of regulations. This is reasonable as long as the community is able to self regulate and ensure it doesn't fund terrorism and any other nefarius uses.
			- **Anti Terrorism Funding** - A credible and verified wallet's ownership can be sold, stollen or transferred. Allowing legitimate funds transfers to get into the hands of terrorists.
			- **Wallet's Value** - Wallet IDs currently have no value and as such are disposable. A fraudster can have a million wallets at little to no cost to him/her.
	- **Intersect Live Online**
		- To develop a single platform that combines curated editorial content, and NFT marketplace and social media channel to onboard Web2 creators into the Web3 space.
		- Showcase a curated list of artists who are engaged with the community to minting NFTs on our marketplace. Allow users to find information on airdrops and auctions, allow users to research and follow creators and connect with the artists to better understand the stories behind each creation. And finally to allow creators and their fans to connect easily on this marketplace.
		- Creators also get personalised profile pages, insights on their performance with fans and on social media, and even get AI suggestions on what actions they should take to improve their standing.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

 - Mockups/designs of any UI components
 - Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
 - An overview of the technology stack to be used
 - Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
 - PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
 - What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
 - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

#### Proposed Solution #1
Introduce a DAO that mints NFT identity tokens for persons, entities, vessels.

 - Personal information is cryptographically encrypted with a public & private key to allow the verification check or identification sharing of the owner through the DAO. Owner will have to sign each request to the DAO to permit access.
 - Issue identity NFTs are permanently issued to a wallet

***Progress Update:** We have a working prototype of an NFT identity token with proposed metadata structure.

#### Proposed Solution #2
Anti-Money Laundering & Know Your Customer 

 - Introduce the use of internationally recognised standards for AML/KYC into the Web3 space. Depending on the country of residence, implement a series of check against the appropriate UN sanctions list, PEP lists (Politically Exposed Person), media adverse, etc.

***Progress Update:** We have a web/mobile app completed. Next phase to incorporate NEAR billing and issuing processes

#### Proposed Solution #3
Fan Reputation

 - **Super Fans** - Instead of airdropping tokens for monetary gains, creators can airdrop reputation NFTs to identify and reward their super fans. Creating a more meaningful way to manage digital relationships without being distorted with money.

***Progress Update:** Pending development of marketplace. Reuses codebase from above projects. We want enable this to be a standalone DAO to enable interoperability.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
	- Intersect is committed to bring long term value to Mintbase and NEAR protocol.
	- **To Mintbase DAO**
		- A new social marketplace powered by Mintbase DAO
		- Attract new wave of creators and new users that will be minting and consuming NFTs minted by Mintbase DAO
		- Monetise and generate more utility for $NEAR
		- Extend Mintbase DAO to enhance NFT transactions to provide additional verifications, security and more.
	- **To NEAR Protocol**
		- Onboard new creators and new users to NEAR
		- Create content and purposes for users to continue to be committed to NEAR
		- Provide AML/KYC Oracles using our existing internationally compliant AML/KYC database
	- This will fundamentally change how NFTs are verified, and will change how NFTs will be valued. Intersects sees a greater and more transparent NFT ecosystem in the near future.
	- We will also see a change in how users value a wallet, shifting from a disposable value store container to something of value that needs time to build value and is worth protecting. The more time and value put into a wallet, the more treasured it becomes. Perhaps for multiple generations.
	- Intersect hopes to create the next generation of common goods to continue the long term benefits of all Web3 users.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
	- **Who is the Intersect for?**
		- Creators, Creator Fans, Event Goers, General Content Consumers
	- **What should Intersect be famous for?**
		- Famous for its base of Creators under the Intersect umbrella (like talent company)
		- Famous for NFT launches (Web3 Launchpad company)
		- Famous for editorial content of Creators (Editorial)
		- Famous for content announcements (PR)
		- Famous for social networking with Creators (limited Facebook)
		- Famous for events and ticketing
- What need(s) does your project meet?
	- Onboarding distinguished and diverse artists and curating diverse  NFT collaborative projects.  Onboarding super fans and wider communities to web3 via physical events and through a marketplace which sells world class works, affordable as editions and rarer 1/1s.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
	- Not that we are aware of, a marketplace, event and metaverse platforms combined
 - If so, how is your project different?
	 - NA
 - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
	 - As a combined team we provide a variety of platforms, web2 and web3 development experience plus traditional/Physical art and events production experience.Thus differentiating ourselves from many other platforms, companies in this market space.
	 - As a collective we will be looking to onboard the next generation of web 3 artists, help transition the traditional artists to web 3 and create a whole new community of art collectors by onboarding their audience. Through curating cutting edge content, artworks, compositions campaigns and experiences.
	 - Gap in NEARs/ Mintbase ecosystem for 1 of 1, distinguished artists and art collectors. The market is flooded with generic, pfp collections that cater to the ‘flipper’ mentality and degen.
	 - Creating awareness and adoption of NEAR capabilities through world class physical exhibitions, multimedia experiences. Working with renowned and midpoint career artists such as Demsky, Helen Knowles, Future Everything and many other artists whether from traditional or crypto/digital native, or other artistic disciplines such as photographers, musicians etc.
	 - Through these exhibitions, we will look to onboard these artists and art collectors within the community and provide them a platform to enter the web 3 space through Mintbase/ NEARS ecosystem partners.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 6 months (just software. no events)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  4 FTE (devs) and 3 FTE (events) or more
- **Total Costs:** $180,000 USD ( see breakdown)
