## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- **Tag line:**
Keyless Solutions For Seamless Sharing


- **Brief Description:**
Partage allows property owners to make money by sharing their properties. It uses advanced smart locks that co-owners or temporary users can open easily with their smartphones, using NFC or Bluetooth signals. This system simplifies access control and monetization of shared properties.

- **How does Partage integrate into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?**
Partage seamlessly integrates into the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem by leveraging Mintbase smart contracts, crafted using their template, to mint access tokens. These tokens enable market-ready smart locks to be compatible with NEAR tokens. Our approach is in harmony with Mintbase’s vision, providing a practical application that enables the unlocking of exclusive content and gated access within the NEAR ecosystem, thereby enriching its functionality and user experience.

- **Why is our team interested in creating this project?**
Our team at Partage is driven by the goal of fostering a sustainable future through the promotion of the sharing economy. We focus on optimizing resource allocation and enhancing functionality. Partage Lock embodies this vision by enabling the efficient monetization of underutilized assets via shared usage. This initiative not only facilitates economic benefits but also advocates for responsible ownership and usage, aiming to reduce overproduction and overconsumption in our society.

Our integration of Bluetooth technologies into Partage Lock ensures robust digital security, leveraging these widely used, reliable standards in modern smartphones. 

Choosing the NEAR Protocol for building Partage underscores our dedication to sustainability and reliability. This aligns with our vision for a web3 sharing economy that not only supports sustainable and social goals but also fosters a community centered around collaborative ownership. In sync with Mintbase's objectives, Partage pioneers an innovative application on the NEAR blockchain. We aim to advance the utility of NFTs by simplifying the use of unlockables and gated content, thus enhancing the experience for NEAR users and contributing to the evolution of blockchain technology in everyday applications.

### Project Details

- **Mockups/designs of any UI components**
  - A full design of our marketplace is available here: 
https://www.figma.com/file/D4u5WSOO1Tq2D7BNy7i6zv/Partage-NFT-Marketplace?type=design&node-id=1647%3A17907&mode=design&t=Zl0EjoPvRDlmdFIw-1 
  - Implemented in a demo version here:
https://hellopartage.xyz 

The above marketplace MVP was built 9 months ago and we are now working on integrating the latest Partage Lock MVP to deliver temporary access keys to a network of smart locks. 

  - A demo version of the first Partage Lock app is available here: https://lock.hellopartage.xyz 
  - We will integrate Mintbase template smart contracts to mint access tokens: https://shorturl.at/qANW3 
  - An example of a temporary access token (an NFT including start date and end date in its metadata) has been minted using Mintbase and is available on partage-lock.testnet wallet: https://www.mintbase.xyz/meta/moments.mintbase1.near:5e2027fd30e5f0dfb26dd3b3e005eeed 

- **Data models / API specifications of the core functionality**
We bring the Partage Lock to its next level of functionality and potential for market deployment through a signed partnership with Master Lock. Master is one of the world's most renowned lock brands, and they released a series of popular devices equipped with Bluetooth technology https://www.masterlock.com/products/bluetooth-electronic-locks?personal. All models from this series (padlocks of various sizes, pin pads, and door controller) are working with the same background technology, which we are integrating as a partner using their SDK and APIs. 

In short, Partage is using Mintbase tokens to control access to market-available Bluetooth devices from Master Lock. In a later step of development, we plan to integrate the Partage Lock app with other smart lock brands to cover a wider market share and various industries. We contacted 59 brands in October and a dozen already confirmed their interest in a partnership by sharing access to their API (including Akiles, Tedee, 2N, Brivo, Igloohome, Assa Bloy, Nuki, Yale, Schlage…)

- **An overview of the technology stack to be used**
We are using a usual NextJs/React stack to build our app with a Near backend smart contract written in Rust, and a Javascript/css frontend. 

- **Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed**
More details about our mission, history, and product are available in our white paper: https://medium.com/partage_xyz/partage-white-paper-v2-c0cbea46e2f8 

  - A slide deck for Partage’s general presentation is available here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-TpH2HP_HUyWBBmEq4RhhOUuiOw2xbeve7yN7WEi1S8/edit#slide=id.p 

  - It features the following architecture sketch:![Partage architecture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GBomJUFXkAA0qx4?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

  - A technical slide deck is used by our dev team to reach our deadlines (Jan 24th, pitch to Encode Club x Near Horizon accelerator). It is available here: [dev pres Jan. 24](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bfBZw7jXl_bvPlXOd2CdYmqmeSxj4JcRtHBPe2AC1OA/edit?usp=sharing) 
 
- **PoC and research on the topic:**
Our project's relevance is underpinned by extensive research into blockchain applications for smart cities, a subject thoroughly explored in our Medium article. This research, drawing from our CEO's academic background, highlights the potential of blockchain-controlled smart locks in urban environments. The key premise is that cities, as hubs for shared utilities, can greatly benefit from blockchain technology to democratize access to common resources, making them easily available via smartphones.
The full article, detailing how blockchain can transform smart city utilities, is accessible here: https://medium.com/partage_xyz/democratizing-access-to-utilities-blockchain-for-smart-cities-25eefb0348e7. 

Furthermore, another Medium article delves into a strategy for deploying Partage Lock, inspired by the principles of "citizen science". It discusses successful citizen-driven implementations of connected devices and suggests strategies for partnering with smart cities and universities for widespread app deployment. This article is available here: https://medium.com/partage_xyz/democratizing-access-to-utilities-citizen-engagement-strategy-in-blockchain-for-smart-cities-352a8096dd22. 

Our best proof-of-concept so far is coming from the clear interest from established industry leaders proposing that we engage in a mutual NDA that gives us access to their open API and reserved developer tools so we could integrate our solution into their devices. 

- **What Partage Lock will and will not provide:**
Partage Lock is designed to provide robust access control for physical assets, tapping into the vast potential of utilizing blockchain technology for real-world applications. As the tech ecosystem explores practical use cases and seeks business models grounded in tangible products, Partage Lock aims to be a frontrunner in onboarding new adopters into the blockchain space.

Currently, Partage does not support the management of digital gated content. However, we have ambitious plans for future expansions in this area, which resonate with our broader mission. Imagine using Partage to distribute revenues from a viral YouTube video among its early supporters, or offering passive income to contributors of a successful artwork or video game. These concepts were explored and subjected to lean experiments targeting niche markets last year. Despite the challenges in finding a straightforward market entry strategy, we remain committed to these ideas. To gain more insights into our market research and findings, you can view our 5-minute video presentation here: https://youtu.be/cWC9rXksXiI?si=m4413wCddohpt1KT 


### Ecosystem Fit
- **Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**
Partage Lock seamlessly integrates into the NEAR ecosystem by aligning with Mintbase's "Unlockables / Gated content" build idea proposition, as detailed in the Mintbase documentation https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/build-ideas. 

Elected as a finalist in the IRL hackathon at Nearcon 23 in Lisbon, Partage has garnered exceptional support from mentors, executives, and the NEAR community. Our pitch is available here: https://www.youtube.com/live/Iw8_04Kk1aw?si=U2PoHlaDgrp5Nfaq&t=16350 

Since we started to work with the Near ecosystem we are feeling very well supported by the Near ecosystem of companies and people. As another proof of appreciation of Partage, we have been selected to join both accelerator programs: the Encode Club x Near https://www.encode.club/near-accelerator from Dec.23 to Jan.24, and the Near Horizon HZN2 starting on Jan.24 https://www.hzn.xyz/hzn/. These selection results have encouraged our confidence in the platform's strength and potential for long-term impact within the NEAR ecosystem.

- **Who is your target audience?**
We are targeting both crypto holders looking for IRL experiences and a means to spend their crypto in their daily lives, and non-crypto owners or utility providers willing to share access to their belongings while starting to collect revenues in cryptocurrencies. 

Our locks could go anywhere in the physical world, they don’t even need an internet connection to check a token’s validity and have an autonomy of about 2 years (with a high daily opening rate of 10 times/day). With both padlocks and door controllers we cover pretty much all scenarios of gated access control (house, office, lockers, cars, bikes, commercial fridges…). 

- **What need(s) does your project meet?**
Partage Lock meets the needs of our market by optimizing resource usage through:
Shared access
Monetizing assets
Secure and traceable transactions
Transparency and decentralization 
Ecosystem partnerships
Alignment with Mintbase's vision for blockchain applications
Sustainability practices

- **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?**
We have reported similar projects on other blockchains, but not in the Near ecosystem as we know. This is encouraging because we can benefit from the experience of other builders, without being directly in competition with them, while we’ll bring Near users a new use case of proven validity.

  - **If so, how is your project different?**
One interesting difference is that the Partage team is globally distributed. Our team members are spread across Europe, America, and Africa. This enhances the project's adaptability and innovation in the competitive landscape. Having different background experiences in tech adoption brings diverse perspectives and expertise from around the world to shape the platform's initiative, as well as a great potential for deployment. Since our team is spread worldwide, we can distribute our Partage Locks to businesses in each team member's area easily and quickly. 

  - **If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?**
- [Myloby](https://myloby.com/) integrates master lock devices to the Thesos blockchain.
- Blockchain-controlled smart locks are a topic of interest for academic research in computer science (see various thesis and papers on the topic), 
- DIY/FabLab/Makerspaces like the use case to build a smart lock on an Arduino board and connect it to a blockchain (see multiple tutorials available).
- No one of our knowledge except [Slock It](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/slock-it) tried to deploy this solution in 2016 for society at scale. They were granted 12M ETH of investments but have been hacked and stolen their funds (ethereum early days).

## Development Status :open_book:
Before Partage, Julien Carbonnell was building Democracy Studio, an empowering platform for citizen engagement in urban development based on machine learning and computational simulation models built during his Ph.D. research in Urban Science. The thesis has been adapted from a book https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Studio-artificial-intelligence-engagement/dp/B098GT2P96  and all models are opened and documented on GitHub https://github.com/DemocracyStudio. 

The post-doctorate period has been to travel the African continent for 8 months to meet with local startup ecosystems and look for ideas to help solve the informal housing challenges https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNgoFFZRfc. As a result of that field research, Partage started with the idea to mint real estate property titles to tackle the lack of cadastre systems https://youtu.be/n8ZNEpoGSXw?si=G4iq6LOWNZVKLZZu in half of the countries in the world (mostly LATAM, Africa, South Asia).

More details about our roadmap, history, and development status are available in our white paper: https://medium.com/partage_xyz/partage-white-paper-v2-c0cbea46e2f8.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:
**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**
At the Encode Club workshop, followed by a 1-1 call with Luis.

- **Work you have already done.**
Aside from the coding of MVPs, research, and all listed above, we just started a partnership with Master Lock. They gave us 8 devices free of charge (worth 1200 USD) to start building with.
![Master Lock devices we start working with](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GBn9TCgWsAA4BIq?format=jpg&name=medium)

- **If any other teams have already contributed (financially) to the project.**
Julien has been self-supporting the project from the beginning. We have never been financially supported yet. Julien and Daniel each received a 1000 USD grant from Near Dev Hub to cover their travels to Nearcon 23 last month.

- **Previous grants you may have applied for.** 
We started to build with the Web3 Startup Lab last year, supported by the Stacks blockchain, but they canceled part 2 of their program (fundraising) because they were lacking investment themselves. We finished 2nd of 16 in their pitch competition to VCs on Feb. 23.
