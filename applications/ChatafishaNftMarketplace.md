## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview:
Our proposal is to integrate Mintbase wallets with Stripe payment into Chatafisha, our Carbon backed NFT platform. This integration will enable us to sell our unique carbon-backed NFTs with metadata on the Mintbase platform, enhancing the reach and accessibility of our sustainability initiatives. The NFTs will contain the metadata of name, location, type of waste as well as amount as a form of impact certificate. The code of the project will then be put into an open-source repository that will allow any blockchain applications and game creators to create marketplaces or solutions that help tackle climate change such as ours. Our project aims to create a transparent and efficient ecosystem for carbon offsetting and waste management, and this integration is a crucial step in achieving our goals.We are also aiming to develop and implement a marketing strategy which will engage users to buy impact certificates on Chatafisha and Mintbase platforms. 


### Project Details:
Our project, Chatafisha, is built on the NEAR Protocol, a powerful and developer-friendly blockchain. We issue carbon-backed NFTs that represent the offset of a specific amount of plastic waste from the environment. These NFTs have real-world value and can be sold or traded. By integrating Mintbase and Stripe, we aim to simplify the purchasing process and expand our user base.
Currently we have our MVP marketplace at https://marketplace.chatafisha.com where anyone can connect their NEAR wallet, submit the metadata and proof of impact and receive a Carbon backed NFT.

### Ecosystem Fit for NEAR and Mintbase:
The integration of Mintbase with the NEAR Protocol aligns with both platforms' focus on simplicity and accessibility. NEAR provides a scalable and developer-friendly environment, while Mintbase is a leading NFT marketplace. This integration will create a user-friendly experience for our community, combining the power of blockchain with traditional payment methods. It will also contribute to the growth of the NEAR and Mintbase ecosystems by bringing sustainability-focused NFTs to a wider audience.
