## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

SoledyNFT is an existing NEAR dapp that links physical items to digital assets. Users can get their own NFT and choose clothes and accessories from exclusive fashion designers, listed on our marketplace. As a result, the users will get their NFTs printed/embroidered on exclusive clothes and accessories.
Our project extends functionality of existing NFT standart. We provide mechanics of breeding functionality - ​​generating more individual NFTs based on parent NFTs. Basically, fashion digital assets owners can breed their NFTs by crossbreeding them with clothes offered by Fashion designers. Thus, breeding allows the owners to generate more individual NFTs for themselves, consisting of fashion digital assets crossbred with clothes.
Additionally, we are building our bundling solution which might attract new categories of users to use NFTs, i.e. fashion consultants, that might create collections of NFTs and clothes and sell them to other users.
Our team includes web developers and designers, fashion marketing specialists and digital marketers, product and project managers, oriented to add value through web3 digital transformation.

**A brief description**

SoledyNFT is a Fashion Marketplace where users can get their NFTs printed/embroidered on exclusive clothes and accessories.
My name is Irina Frolov. I have been a fashion marketing specialist for more than 6 Years. During my professional career, I understood that people want to share their remarkable individuality by the clothes and accessories they wear. Moreover, they want to have in their wardrobe "those" clothes and "those" accessories, that make them look and feel “unique”.

What makes clothes look “unique”? It is the graphic elements, like those on images below:
#images 1,2,3 in row
This is what our platform does: it digitizes the clothes' graphic elements and transforms it into NFT, so that the users can own the digital assets based on which the design of their clothes is made:
#images 4,5 in row
On the other hand, fashion designers can upload their clothes on our platform, so that the users can choose the clothes on which to print/embroider their NFTs and create clothing collections out of them.  

**How your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem**

SoledyNFT platform is already integrated into Near Ecosystem, as it accepts payments in Near, the authorisation system works with Near wallet logination module and the smart contracts are built using Near SDK and API. We pursue now to extend NFT marketplace functionality by developing:
- Fashion digital assets NFT minting module
- NFT clothing breeding module: fashion digital assets owners can breed their NFTs by crossbreeding them with clothes offered by Fashion designers. Thus, breeding allows the owners to generate more individual NFTs for themselves, consisting of fashion digital assets crossbred with clothes
- NFT generating collections module (bundling solution)
We intend to build the above modules using Mintbase API. We are aiming to extend existing Mintbase functionality, by developing our bundling solution and breeding concept.

**Why our team is interested in creating this project**

Our project aims to hand over the ownership over the digital assets based on which the design of the clothes is made from manufacturers to consumers.
Our goal is to educate brands from the real fashion industry on how to benefit and unlock the real value of the NFT market. Same way as the Near Ecosystem is supporting its community, so shall we do with fashion brands. We will support them in building the NFT marketplace on Near, using our open-source code, and with any other issues related to developing and creating on Near and Mintbase.


### Project Details

- SoledyNFT NEAR dapp (web3 ecommerce platform): https://soledynft.shop/en
- Projects’ git: https://github.com/irinasoledy/soledynft
- Architectural overview of technical solution: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOECJpuw=/?moveToWidget=3458764532298413154&cot=14

Technology Stack:
- Front End and Back End web technologies based on JS (Node JS, Vue JS, React, Next JS, etc.)
- Back End web technologies based on PHP (Laravel, PHP 8+, etc.)
- Server administration technologies (Apache, Nginx, SSH, etc.)
- Front End web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JQUERY, BOOTSTRAP, etc.)
- Blockchain technologies (Rust, Assembly Script, Near API & SDK, Mintbase API)


### Ecosystem Fit

Our project fits into the ecosystem as a first fashion ecommerce and NFT marketplace built on Near. Our goal is to educate brands from the real fashion industry on how to benefit and unlock the real value of the NFT market. 
Additionally,  we pursue to extend Mintbase functionality by implementing the NFT breeding module and NFT bundling solution. 

Our target audience is the users, interested in Fashion and being curious about crypto and tech. We also aim to nurture fashion brands and consultants to use the NFT market.

Currently, we didn’t find any other project on Near blockchain that envisages the fashion industry, by handing over the ownership over the clothes design from manufacturers to consumers. Of course, there are web3 projects that offer buyers to print NFTs on clothes, such as https://www.uniqly.io/. But those NFTs look very high-tech (ugly) and have nothing in common with the real fashion industry. Additionally we aim to implement breeding functionality, which is also a standing out concept.

It is necessary to have many Years of experience in the Fashion Industry and understanding of the development environment and NFT technologies in order to succeed. Our team has it all.

## Future Plans

In the short term, we will work with:
- the fashion designers in order to attract their clothing collections and display them on our platform. 
- the global fashion marketplaces (W&B, NJAL, Farfetch), in order to advertise through them the products from our platform

Our project aims to hand over the ownership over the digital assets based on which the design of the clothes is made from manufacturers to consumers. Reason is that we want to nurture our audience and unlock for them the power of the NFT market, guide them on how to gain the ownership over their preferred digital assets, how to create their own clothing design (by using breeding functionality) and their own collections of NFTs in digital space and clothing IRL. To achieve that goal we are going to launch a dozen educational articles on news platforms related to fashion and on social media.
