# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Gorilla Shops - Batch Minter Automat
- **Team Name:** Gorilla Funds UG
- **Payment Address:** gorillashops.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Gorilla Shops is building the Batch-Minting-Tool "Automat". This Batch-Minting-Tool will provide an easy solution to mint and list collections just by uploading a well formed zip-File. This will make it easy to mint thousands of NFTs on Mintbase just with a few clicks.

### Project Details

The Tool will consists of two parts. An open API and a User Interface. The API will be open for everyone to use and the User Interface will be easy to add into your own project. The User Interface will be easy to customize so that it can be used by everyone, who wants to add this additional functionality to their DApps.
The Tool is in the first round designed to work best with Gorilla Shops Figma Plug-In Unikat. In the second iteration it will be generalized to make minting of batches and performing batch transactions like transfering of NFTs or Airdrops of NFTs way more easy like it is now.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Automat is a usefull tool to help all projects that want to work with larger amounts of NFTs. Especially it is helpfull for creators of NFT collections.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

We target Mintbase users that want to leverage Mintbase for minting collections or bigger amounts of NFTs.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

The API and the User Interface targets Mintbase Store owners that want to produce NFTs in larger amounts as they want to mint collections of unikats or thousands of NFTs.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?

As the project is designed to use with the Figma-Plugin their is right now no similar project out there.

- If so, how is your project different?

## Clarifications

The Code for the User Interface will be released under MIT-License. The backend code is not part of this proposal. The API-will be open for anyone to use who is the owner of a store on Mintbase.

## Future Plans

The next part of "Automat" will be a generalized version, that allows way more options for the minting operation of the NFTs, like individual options per NFT. Minting of thousands of just one NFT and way more.The following version will also add an easy white-label solution that can easily be integrated in your very own web app.
