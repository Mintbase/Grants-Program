## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

- Create your NFTs using keywords! AI ‚û°Ô∏è Art üé® Powered by @Terraspaces...
- An AI generator platform that provides content creators the ability to customize an image search with keywording, use basic photo editor tools, & mint their customized generation(s).
- This project integrates Mintbase's mint engine, utilizing it as a launchpad, as web3 content creators will be able to embed their preferred metadata descriptions pre-mint with zero-coding necessary. We recognize that NEAR's humanized wallet experience(using .near address set-up) creates an ease-of-access approach to onboarding a userbase directly from social networks based on web2 concepts. (i.e: social media handles/gamertags/alias pseudonyms, etc)
- We understand the growing creator economy is vital to a socially impacting network; after building Terraspaces, we acknowledge the growing demand for high volume of content output to be curated in today's social media climate.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

1) Any mockups or design concepts prior to us delivering a milestone may or may not be presented during an interview/meeting discussing future potential with a Mintbase grant. We do not objectify our developments simply by presenting preview mock-ups, as we are builders who conceptualize innovative ideas that break paradigms in web3 tech solutions. Please refer to our website https://terraspaces.io for a preview of what we can build in our own rite. Milestones will be provided with descriptioned details on what we have accomplished, coding language, & API specifications regarding 'Mintbase Mint Engine' & our image search functionality/photo editor concept.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

1) In our niche, we appeal to the demand of content creators entering the NFT/crypto space, with the interest of creating content faster than ever before.
2) Our target demographic is derived from our current userbase via Terraspaces, as well as integrating shareable compatibility with platforms like Instagram/TikTok/Twitter. This allows us to market directly where the conversations are happening.
3) We fulfill the growing interest in content creators, developing a 'creator economy' that can keep up with the modern-day saturation from social media content creation.
4) Currently, there are no existing projects in the NEAR ecosystem that serve directly to this content creation niche, the only forms of this that exists via blockchain are available on ETH at this time. (i.e. Wombo.Art - ETH)

- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Mintbase Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

1) As discussed with Mintbase team member (Maria Magdalena), we want to develop a system that runs in automation, that provides the resources available for content creators to find appeal in Web3 useability, directly impacting the amount of NFT wallets created via NEAR(or any chain we become compatible w.) 

We understand that the clearest way to bring intristic value to a digital platform, is to humanize it in ways that are relatable, convenient for everyday usage, & creates a liquid experience(something that impacts you online/or offline).

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ‚âà 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

1) Total Estimated Duration: 60 Days
2) Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): 5 FTE
3) Total Costs: 30,000 USD

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

1) By leveraging the reach of social engagement via Twitter/Instagram/YouTube/TikTok/+ more. We can connect directly to the social demographic that is our niche
audience. This will be done with Tiktok campaigns that highlight the useability of AI generators, as well as reaction videos curated by select influencers, cementing
strong narrative of what this would entail for the future of content creation. Our brand recognizes where we can excel, so we prefer to play off of our strength.

As well as more traditional forms of digital marketing such as SEO optimization, backlinks, Google ads, etc. 

In terms of maintenance beyond our milestones, we will update our AWS hosting as we progress the amount of databases we build on the backend.
The UI/UX will have casual tweaks & updates, providing moderate improvements as we come closer to a polished product.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Web3 Foundation Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.

- Work you have already done.
- If there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project.
- Previous grants you may have applied for.

1) Thank you for your time & energy making it this far into our application, we are proud to present Slushii as one of the strongest facing brands for an AI Generator/public-use platform in web3 creative resources.
2) Please visit our website https://terraspaces.io for more demonstrative detail of what we have built on our 1st platform. 
5) By establishing an inexpensive royalties system per 'mint'. We will route all royalty funding to slushii-royalties.near to establish a consistent passive stream of funding for developments/general maintenance via core team. Through this, our goal will be to promote to a large userbase, where the upscale potential of our user traffic will determine the success of our business model.
