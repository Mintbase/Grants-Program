## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

We would like to add to the ability for a NFT project owner that already knows how to use WordPress with WooCommerce to use MintBase as the underlying technology to launch their NFT project, 
maintain their own marketplace and use these NFT as a gating to other sections of the site. 
We are interested in doing this because we have already created the NFT gating NEAR plugin.  We feel that artists would also like to maintain everything in an enviroment they already know.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

We would create a flow between how creating a ecommerce marketplace within Woocommerce works today with integration within MintBase APIs.
Based on this flow we would create wireframes needed to pass on the to the geeks to start implmentation of the front/back end. 


We would be using as much of the native WP stack as possible with GoLang/Rust as a backup for anything WP cannot handle natively. Meaning if we need a middle ware component between WP and MintBase our goto would be Golang/Rust.

We see a simular plugin being used with Ethereum but the flow is not super easy.  We would take this same concept but also use feedback from the artists on how to better the flow. 


### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

We love how Mintbase is concentrating on the ease of use. We feel taking this same methodology but putting it to the #1 used CMS by artist would be an ecosystem match. 
If we do this correctly the Artist would not need to hire a geek to help them create their NFT projects inside their already used website. There would not be any redirects or two system accounting issues.
