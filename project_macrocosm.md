## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Macrocosm’s Play-to-Evolve real-time strategy game builds on existing P2E concepts, taking revolutionary steps in crafting a game universe shaped directly by community actions and decisions. 

The team in parallel is building a proprietary no-code solution to evolve our game with a community driven incentives, but also act as a framework for other developers to build their own P2E Games.  

**Macrocosm the Game: 
**
Macrocosm is a blockchain-powered, Play to Earn and Play to Evolve real-time strategy game set in a post-apocalyptic future where Earth is no longer a thriving home for humanity.

As a community-driven game, Macrocosm will not only present players with the power to decide the future of its worlds but also directly create in-game content. Our no-code solution will allow community members to launch new planets with unique stories, buildings, economics.

The game is already playable and demoable as a 2D, while 3D development already started. 

About our P2E Gaming Framework:
When it comes to the gaming framework- we have already given permissioned access to creators to experiment with their own Play 2 earn games. Three developers have launched their own games which are already playable using our infrastructure.

Built-in-CLI: Moderators can access advanced tools to control game aspects from Macrocosm's web command-line interface

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
We have identified three categories that fit in the Mintbase ecosystem:

Designers & Artists: The community will evolve through community input, hence we are planning to work with Mintbase artists/ designers to design the next phases of the game such as launching new planets
Game Players & NFT Collectors: People interested in playing our game, being part of our community, and collect our 3D NFTs that will be offered through Mintbase marketplace. 
Developers: We are building also a no-code P2E game framework, which later can compliment/ support the capabilities which can combined with Mintbase's no-code minter, market, and redeemer 

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

We are planning to create our community, but also looking to get support from NEAR creator ecosystems, gaming dapps, and NFT marketplaces. 
- What need(s) does your project meet?
We are currently need resources to amplify our marketing, and continue our development roadmap. The first season of our game is fully playable, and now starting to focusing on launching efforts- since we spent the last 6 months working on product. 
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
There are different P2E games on NEAR. Most of them are Coming Soon, so we don't have the opportunity to test them since are current development. We are not aware of any P2E gaming framework currently on NEAR. 
  - If so, how is your project different?
 Our main differentation from the P2E games is the level of customisation that is possible for users and their ability to really play an active part in creating the chapters of the game. All it it takes are design skills and passion to contribute to the game. No development skills are required, since all details are customisable from our user-end. 
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
 While it's far away from being similar, our vision is comparable to https://treasure.lol/ (MAGIC DAO on Arbitrum). Treasure is building a decentralized 'game console' and publisher stack. They have three components: Cartridges: Games and metaverses built from the ground up by Treasure and seasoned builders Community: Composite of many smaller communities, connected through lore, guilds, resources Infrastructure: The shared economic engine, tooling and resources that powers the ecosystem and empowers builders.
We are similarly aiming to build an ecosystem that game designers and passionate builders will launch their own games, using our token as in-game currency, and access the Macrocosm ecosystem.

- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration will be 3 FTE 
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project 50,000 USD

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Mintbase Modules

- **Estimated duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 15,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License |  MIT /
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Mintbase nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | SDK| We will launch a Mintbase PHP SDK which is important to connect it with our game-engine infrastructure
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an articlethat explains that Macrocosm is a recipient of the Mintbase grant, what we aim to achieve, our contribution to the NEAR ecosystem, and how designers, game developers, and the community could benefit from our no-code P2E infrastructure 

### Milestone 2 Build the blockchain components of our P2E framework 

- **Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  4
- **Costs:** 25,000 USD
- **Context:** Currently, our game engine for developers to build their own P2E games is focused on the back-end game mechanics, and we need to develop sync tools to automate the backend with blockchain contracts. We have used Enjin & Tatum SDKs to compliment the blockchain functions such as mint in-game tokens, NFTs, conversion of points, exchanges, marketplaces. We are now aiming to simplify the user experience by using our own components along with Mintbase NFTs capabilities to empower the user experience. 

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License |  MIT /
| 0b. | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can launch their own game. We will launch a dedicated website other than macrocosm.game to separate the framework from our own game.|
| 0c. | Blockchain Game Engine|  Work in delivering the following capabilities for game devs: *Launching in-game tokens/ currencies
*Implement upgradable NFT standards *On-chain VRF primitive to fetch randomness *NTFs representing skill trees, portable to any mod of the game *A quest factory contract where anyone can deploy and import their quest in the game *More functions that will be identified based on further user interviewing. 

### Milestone 3 Test-in Practice by Launching Macrocosm & Provide support for the development of other P2E games

- **Estimated duration:** 2 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 10,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | Publicly launch Macrocosm & enable a season that community designers and inspired game players are building their own planets, stories, and islands on Macrocosm. 
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide extensive documentation how they will be able to launch new planets, stories, and islands. 
| 0c. | Support external developers to launch their own game and provide tech support, along gathering feedback, testing, and accommodating feedback. 

## Future Plans

As a very first step, we are planning on launching our own game Macrocosm and enable community to co-design with us the next seasons and planets of our metaverse. We will launch our NFT collection + land sale during Q4 2022, along our fundraising efforts. 

Long-term, we will focus on creating an ecosystem and provide our technology for new P2E to be developed, along creating synergies...Today, you will discover that most blockhcain games are not playable, or are not really blockchain games and just have NFT components or a crypto token, but all the other game is fully centralised. We hope to contribute to change this :)
