## **Project Overview** ðŸ“„

Waka NFT infrastructure for influencers (NFT-Marketplace, user-feed, social utility creation tool and earnings dashboard)

### **Overview**

Waka wants to diversify NFT-utility. For that, reimagining the NFT-utility for the end user is a must. The market currently is tough and old NFT selling models does not work. The PFP-Market is dying out. On the other hand NFT-Technology has so much to offer from both a narrative and a practical use. We would like to popularize NFTs of experience and give tools to a new wave of NFT-creators.

We plan to bring new users into the Near from web2 with the help of Mintbase. Additionally, influencers with millions of subscribers will be promoting NFTs from Near.

TikTok Creators build their following on noticing new patterns in social media and building upon them. In our case the end user also participates in co-creation of the content. At this point of our platform development, influencers are those who start a trend and end-users build upon it and reshare.

We want to present our new project - NFT infrastructure for Influencers with a core feature of NFT-Milestones. The vision of waka is to create a Sandbox level of freedom for socializing and finding friends and dates. The idea of a NFT-Milestones expands a set of tools for influencers, brands, DAOs to create, monetize and engage the end-user with exclusive NFT-experience.

Our app can be seen as a two-sided marketplace. One side consists of creators (influencers, DAOs, NFT collections etc.), who bring content to the app by creating their exclusive content and another side consists of users who enjoy the content and pay for it. All waka content also has social utility. Waka-rooms can build on top of collections of memes, horoscopes, fun tests and other easy-to-consume content.

On waka content is used to create a context for social interaction between users. The new feature will allow us to target users who already have a context in their interaction and we will use that context to create content for building a bond between users and storing a proof of bond on an indestructible blockchain.

Our idea is to create an easy flow for influencers to develop their own collections of NFTs and market them on WAKA. The marketplace will be open-source, which means that any other project, which works with influencers will be able to give them the opportunity to create a collection in a matter of minutes and then connect utility to their main product.

Users will also be building their digital identity by storing milestones of their relationships and other waka-tokens on the blockchain with our help. With time digital identity, which they have built on waka, will be interoperable with other Near social apps.
 We plan to allow users to post their co-created content into our news feed. This will be an optional thing to do, if one decides to keep their nft private it will be encrypted and stored on IPFS. This NFT feed creates FOMO (someone creates NFT bonds with my friends), shows users what they can do on waka and fuels our app with scrollable content.
 All the infrastructure together represents a tool for influencers to work transparently and earn royalties.

### **Project Details**

Currently registered users convert in 8% of the cases (buy access to a paid room). We consider it to be a good conversion, which we believe is optimizable to 10% in the near future. The interesting part is that paying users convert in most of the cases within the first 10 min using the app, with median time to convert 2m 13s as shown on the diagram below. For an app with microtransactions it is extremely important to have a good percentage of users, who start paying as early as possible.

However the challenge, which we are facing is that average revenue per paying user is only 2.07$. The reason is that there is a lack of monetization features for the consequent purchases and NFT Marketplace will be providing that continuation.

_Figure 1. How quick waka users make purchases after their registration_

Our surveys and interviews of paying users show that they in 55% of the cases pay for fun content from an influencer (main reason for the purchase). In 30% of the cases the main reason for payment on WAKA is to support influencers. Both of those reasons give the implication that our users will also be interested in owning exclusive content from their favorite influencers in the form of NFTs.
 Additionally after conducting interviews with partner influencers, we see that on average it takes them 40-120 min to come up with an idea for a matching room and implement it in our constructor, generally influencers were very optimistic regarding the process of creation. Based on those insights we can see that on one side we will not have a shortage of creativity from the influencers and on the other side there will be demand for NFTs.

**General flow**

We want to allow influencers to earn money through their creativity. Influencers will own royalties for NFTs and get paid in Near. They will be able to track earning of their royalties through a fully transparent Near powered dashboard.

**Marketplace**
On waka influencers will be able to create their own marketplace, where they will be able to sell social template NFTs. Those templates will be bought by users and used to have more fun in interaction. Waka will be advertising different social NFT-experiences to users also based on their Customer Journey.

**Tool for creation and minting of experience-NFT**
 This tool allows users to choose social context from a dropdown and create a fun template for users. Examples create a template for NFT-Marriage, NFT-BFF-vow, NFT-achievement of 100 matches on waka, Icebreaker with a personal secret of an influencer etc. Those templates then will be sold on waka marketplace, through push notification, in waka rooms, chat. Creators will then get most of the revenue cut, when users buy their content.

**In-chat integration of co-creation, co-minting**
 Most of the social templates will be used inside of the chat. Users will be able to reply or interact with a social template from an influencer. They will be able to mint filled out templates straight from the chat. When template is filled out two Experience-NFTs are minted to wallets of the users. No additional transaction fees are taken. Waka funds creation of a wallet if necessary.

**Dashboard for influencer revenue-tracking**
 Influencers will be able to withdraw rewards in Near. Add new NFTs to their collections or delete them. Creators will be able to see incoming and outcoming transactions.
 For us it is very important to stay transparent with our partner influencers. The best way for us to stay transparent is a blockchain and open-source code.Transparency allows us to work with influencers on better terms (performance based, shared revenue). For us it results in several benefits:
 1. better cash flow (we don't have to pay influencer in advance)
 2. protection from boosted (fake) influencers (problem of influencers with fake subs asking for fixed payment)
 3. aligned incentives (influencers are motivated to bring as many people to waka to earn as much)
 4. scalable approach (we don't have to payout influencers individually)
 5. possible payouts in crypto (influencers with millions of subs become familiar with crypto and Near in particular and can better educate their audience)
 6. trust from influencers (it is not often that influencers work on % basis, they are afraid that their partner is not providing the real testimonials and statistics)

**Encryption of personal NFTs (with Verida SDK)**
 Some users will want their NFTs to be stored deep in the internet, so no one except them will be able to see them. Thus those users should have the option to encrypt the data connected to their NFTs and we will provide this option. Additionally, to be compliant with GDPR's "right to be forgotten" we have to store personal information outside of blockchain so it can be deleted, when a user wants it.

**News feed for co-created content**
 After a social template is used it can be published on a news feed. Users will get reactions from other users on that content (likes and shares). At the same time these posts will be promoting Experience-NFTs for other users, since they will be able to see the origin of the NFT

**Flow for web2 users (with MyNearWallet + Stripe)**
 Most of our users are non-crypto, so for providing them with the best UX we need an easy flow to register wallets for them. We will work with MyNearWallet to create a flow which allows us to create Near wallet without leaving waka. Additionally we will provide web2 users with a possibility to purchase NFTs for fiat.

**Rework waka NFT-gallery**
 Previously we tested NFT-gallery functionality. However it needs to be adapted to the new system.
 Users will have a gallery of NFTs and memories which will encompass all the fun and sweet stuff they did on waka. Any time our user will feel lonely they will be able to open their gallery and see that they are not alone. Our gallery will be Mintbase

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZSB31W2/Group-1413.png" data-canonical-src="https://i.ibb.co/ZSB31W2/Group-1413.png" width="400" />
_Figure 3. waka NFT-gallery_

Additionally this web3 infrastructure will be wrapped into web2 infrastructure. Thus users will be able to buy NFTs for fiat and they will be able to buy them even without a wallet.

_Figure 3. Architecture of a system for minting Experience-NFTs_

We use a technical method proposed by NEAR, which means using smart contracts on the backend and some frontend

The marketplace will be developed in React with Node.js backend, MongoDB, hosted on AWS. We will utilize Mintbase API methods to develop our Marketplace.

### **Ecosystem Fit**

We firmly believe that blockchain social apps will be dominating the market in the future due to interoperability across all other social apps and full data ownership.

There is the problem of adapting blockchain for the masses, namely NFT and its utility. Near provides great infrastructure for onboarding web2 users and we want to use it. For us it is a part of a bigger plan (NFT-\>in-app non-tradable token-\>tradable token-\>IDO)

We target currently young people 18-25 y.o., who are aware of current trends, who use Instagram and Tiktok, and follow rather quirky influencers. As creators of our platform are concerned, we bring those influencers to our platform who are not blindly following the mainstream. Influencers who actively try to be creative and build their brand on being different.

We create transparent infrastructure for influencers and content creators. Allows to work for a percentage of the earnings.

There are other social apps on Near, however they currently don't focus on the problem of transparent earnings for influencers, they also don't share our approach to experience NFTs.

## **Future Plans**

Depending on the metrics of the platform we will improve the functionality. Firstly there is a plan to make levels of referrals. For example:
 For Collection A there are 10 first-level NFTs which give you an opportunity to get 10% of royalties from NFT collection sales. It is up to the Creator how those NFTs will be distributed. Holders of those 10 NFTs can sell up to 10 NFTs each and share their own royalty with them. Since the total reward is capped by the perpetual royalty, it is far from a ponzi scheme.

We plan to bring more and more utility for users by empowering creators. An example of such empowerment can be: The NFT sticker-engine, whichwill allow influencers to create their own sticker packs and distribute them as NFTs. We will provide templates for influencers, so they will need to take a picture of themselves and add a short text to a particular emotion. Easy, fast and fun to use.

The NFT marketplace can be improved in the future by providing fractionalised ownership . Influencers sure have a lot of people who believe in them.

Our goal is to double our Average revenue per paying user with the above mentioned features. We will implement more features for influencers for a fast creation of value for their users in the form of NFT.

In the future we will improve data ownership, so users will have more options to share their data to different user groups on waka and outside.

 The ownership of Influencer Store will also be tokenized in the future, making it possible to have shared revenue from a store. Others will be able to invest in stores or just purchase it altogether.

## **Additional Information** âž•

How did you hear about the Grants Program?

We found out about the grant because we communicate with the Mintbase team very often. We have previously had many small projects together. Like joint animation competition from waka to Amber and Mintbase-room on waka.
