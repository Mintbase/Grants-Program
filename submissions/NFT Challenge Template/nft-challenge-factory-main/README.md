# NFT Challenge Template

Generate blockchain challenges that validate if users have all the challenge pieces! Capabilities include burning challenge pieces on completion, as well as minting a reward piece on completion. Users can also set an expiration date for their challenge, as well as set the maximum amount of winners for the challenge.

## Important: 
If you plan on burning challenge NFTs on completion, make sure users who try to complete the challenge **give the challenge contract transfer approval for their challenge piece NFTs**, so that the challenge contract can burn them.
If you plan on minting the reward NFT through the challenge contract, ensure you make the **challenge contract a minter of the reward NFT contract**.



## Run the project

    yarn install

    yarn run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

We have set the environment variables necessary to get the template working on testnet right out of the box for you in the `env.example` file, simply rename it `env.local` and you'll be good to go! If you want to use the template on mainnet or have your own deployed challenge factory contract, change the environment variable values as desired.

A lot of the components for this template uses components generated by [v0](https://v0.dev), an AI frontend component generator. Here's a list of components I generated for this project, you can play around with the prompts to modify the components.
