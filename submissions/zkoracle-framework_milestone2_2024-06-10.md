## Documentation

This milestone encapsulates the integration of zkProofs into the Near Blockchain, using Aurora as a proxy for EVM (Groth16) SNARK verification. An EVM platform is necessary because the ZK Prover currently generates parameters for Groth16 SNARKs on EVM blockchains.

While zkProof verification directly on Near is feasible and under research, it has not yet been successfully implemented. Therefore, as per the original milestone deliverables, the Aurora EVM Blockchain, which includes SDKs for Aurora <> Near communication, is used to verify zkProofs and establish a registry for verified zkProofs that encapsulate the verification of social data from X (Twitter).

The full documentation, detailing the deployment of various contracts and the operation of the ZK Prover, can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/usherlabs/x-twitter-nfts/blob/9a10a819d982c6ff0d90238f636051cf8d069f13/README.md). In this documentation, we will highlight the steps to:

1. Generate a zkProof of X (Twitter) data.
2. Verify the zkProof in an Aurora transaction.
3. Cross-reference this verification in a Near Smart Contract transaction to authenticate subsequent steps, such as minting an NFT according to standards established by Mintbase.

### Execution

1. Navigate to the zkaf repo
   - Moved into X (Twitter) NFTs â€” [src/zkaf](https://github.com/usherlabs/x-twitter-nfts/blob/9a10a819d982c6ff0d90238f636051cf8d069f13/src/zkaf)

2. *(Optional)* [Follow the deployment process outlined in the README.md](https://github.com/usherlabs/x-twitter-nfts/blob/9a10a819d982c6ff0d90238f636051cf8d069f13/README.md#smart-contracts)

3. Install pre-requisite software libraries and technologies:
   1. Install Foundry [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
   2. Install the [necessary toolchain to build the program](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install)
   3. Install Docker:
      - To deterministically build the ZK Circuit / Guest, Docker must be running â€” [Learn more](https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#deterministic-builds)
    
4. Provide all environment variables
   1. See all required environment variables: [src/zkaf/.env.sample](https://github.com/usherlabs/x-twitter-nfts/blob/9a10a819d982c6ff0d90238f636051cf8d069f13/src/zkaf/.env.sample)
   2. If you have not deployed the Smart Contracts using your own wallets, and do not have access to RiscZero's Bonsai managed ZK compute environment, Usher Labs can provide testnet Near and Aurora private keys and associated environment variables on an ad-hoc basis, or provide a live demo of this execution.
    
5. Run the publisher to generate and verify the proof:
 
    ```sh
    cargo run --bin publisher
    ```

## Formatted Code

Originally, the [ZKAF R0 (Framework) codebase](https://github.com/usherlabs/zkaf-r0) and the [X (Twitter) NFTs Game](https://github.com/usherlabs/x-twitter-nfts) were separate repositories, demonstrating that the framework for processing ZK Attestation is composable. This allows applications like the X (Twitter) NFT Game to adopt and use these modules to deliver an end-to-end verifiable data protocol that verifies social data within the Near Blockchain. 

However, for simplified development, the [ZKAF has temporarily been merged into the X (Twitter) NFTs repository](https://github.com/usherlabs/x-twitter-nfts/tree/main/src/zkaf), allowing for streamlined dependency management and operation. The goal of separating the framework into a standalone dependency of the X (Twitter) NFT Game will be achieved in a future milestone.

**The code distribution:**

1. Solidity Smart Contracts are designed to deploy to Aurora to manage the registry of verified zkProofs.
2. Near Smart Contracts and the ZKAF logic are programmed in strictly typed Rust.
3. Comments are included among various steps in the logic to aid in understanding the flow and processing of data.
