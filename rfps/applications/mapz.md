## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview


**Tag Line (One Sentence Summary):
**Mapz: Empowering Communities by Revolutionizing EV Charging, Gas Price, and Traffic Incident Reporting through Decentralization.

**A Brief Description of Mapz:
**Mapz is a pioneering project aiming to revolutionize the way we access information about EV charging, gas prices, and traffic incidents. Unlike current market solutions like Plugshare, Gasbuddy, and Waze, which are extractive in nature and offer limited benefits to their contributing communities, Mapz is designed to reward and empower its users. By harnessing the power of Web3 and blockchain technology, Mapz provides a decentralized platform where users not only share and access real-time data but also receive tangible rewards for their contributions. This shift in the power structure ensures that the value generated by the community is equitably distributed among its members.

**Relation to / Integration into the Mintbase / NEAR Ecosystem:
**Mapz integrates with the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem by utilizing NFTs to redefine user engagement and ownership. These NFTs represent not just rewards but also virtual land parcels within the Mapz platform. Owners of these parcels can earn advertising revenue, democratizing the way the app operates and its revenue is distributed. By minting these NFTs on the NEAR protocol, we leverage its scalability and cost-effectiveness, while aligning with Mintbase’s vision of a creator-centric economy. This innovative approach not only incentivizes user participation but also contributes to the broader goal of a more equitable and decentralized digital economy.

**Why Your Team is Interested in Creating This Project:
**Our team is driven by the vision of creating a more equitable and participatory digital ecosystem. We believe that Mapz has the potential to disrupt the status quo of community extractive platforms by providing a fair and rewarding system. Our passion lies in leveraging blockchain technology to solve real-world problems, promoting sustainable transportation, and building a community-driven platform where every participant is recognized and rewarded. The opportunity to create a platform that not only serves a practical purpose but also upholds the values of decentralization, fairness, and community empowerment is at the heart of our commitment to this project. We know people need what Mapz offers because the growth of the EV market is undeniable, and we have seen firsthand user frustrations on various user forums and EV publications with the unrealiable state of charging infrastructure. None of the existing solutions have adequately addressed this problem. Mapz combines my passion for bringing web2 users into web3 and addresses a real pain point for a growing user base.


### Project Details

**Mockups/Designs of any UI Components:
**Our MVP already showcases a functional and user-friendly interface, which can be viewed at http://app.mapz.live/. Additionally, we have Figma design files for all UI elements, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user experience across our platform. We can provide the figma files as we advance through the application process. 

**Data Models / API Specifications of the Core Functionality:
**Our database, built on Postgres, comprehensively covers EV chargers across North America. Users can check-in to chargers and leave reviews. We can provide the full database structure and back-end API design, which facilitates these interactions efficiently.

**Overview of the Technology Stack to be Used:
**Mapz is developed using React (Next.js) for the web interface and React Native for mobile. The back-end technology is based on Postgres. For our NFTs, we have opted for the Polygon Mumbai network for minting, and our decentralized front-end PoC is hosted on the ICP network.

**Documentation of Core Components, Protocols, Architecture, etc. to be Deployed:
**We have developed a NFT map navigator on web2 technologies, accessible at https://mapz.vercel.app/, and a decentralized one at https://onzmk-taaaa-aaaal-acw4a-cai.icp0.io/. Our architecture is designed to ensure seamless integration of blockchain technology and NFTs into our platform.

**PoC/MVP or Other Relevant Prior Work or Research on the Topic:
**Our MVP, available at http://app.mapz.live/, serves as a testament to our capabilities and vision. It demonstrates our commitment to providing a comprehensive solution for EV owners and incorporates features like charger check-ins and reviews.

**What Your Project is Not or Will Not Provide or Implement:
**Mapz is dedicated to creating a decentralized platform primarily for EV charging infrastructure. While our initial focus has been on this area, we are also expanding our scope to include crowd-sourced gas price information and traffic incident reporting. These additional features are on track to be completed by the end of this month. However, it is important to note that our platform is not aimed at conventional fuel vehicle services beyond gas price monitoring. Our primary dedication remains towards EV technologies and services, aligning with our vision of promoting sustainable and innovative transport solutions.



### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and How Does Your Project Fit into the Ecosystem?
**Mapz integrates seamlessly into the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem by utilizing blockchain technology to decentralize and democratize information sharing related to EV charging stations, gas prices, and traffic incidents. Our project introduces a unique model where users are rewarded for their contributions through NFTs, fostering a more inclusive and participative community.

**Who is Your Target Audience?
**Our primary target audience includes environmentally conscious consumers, specifically EV owners and enthusiasts. Secondary audiences are users interested in gas prices and traffic incident reporting. We are also targeting blockchain and crypto enthusiasts who see the value in decentralized applications and NFTs.

**What Need(s) Does Your Project Meet?
**Mapz addresses the lack of reliable, up-to-date information on EV charging infrastructure, gas prices, and traffic incidents. Current market solutions are often extractive, offering little to no tangible benefits to users who contribute valuable information. Mapz changes this dynamic by rewarding contributors and giving them a stake in the platform.

**Are There Any Other Projects Similar to Yours in the Mintbase / NEAR Ecosystem?
**While there might be projects addressing individual aspects like traffic information or NFT integrations, Mapz stands out by combining these elements in a unique way. We are not aware of any other project in the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem that blends EV charging information, gas prices, traffic incident reporting, and NFT rewards into one cohesive platform.

**If Not, Are There Similar Projects in Related Ecosystems?
**In broader ecosystems, there are platforms like PlugShare for EV charging information, GasBuddy for gas prices, and Waze for traffic reporting. However, Mapz differentiates itself by being decentralized and offering tangible rewards and ownership to its community through NFTs, setting a new standard in community engagement and benefit.
