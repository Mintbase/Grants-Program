### Overview


**Tag Line (One Sentence Summary):**
Mapz: Navigating the Future of EV Charging with Community Power and Blockchain Innovation

__A Brief Description of Mapz:__
Mapz is at the forefront of transforming the electric vehicle (EV) charging experience by leveraging the shared economy model and blockchain technology. The EV charging market is rapidly expanding, with projections indicating a significant increase in EV adoption globally. However, this growth is hindered by challenges such as limited public charger availability, expensive charging costs, and underutilized private chargers.
At Mapz, we're developing a platform that connects EV drivers with private charging station owners, akin to an 'Airbnb for EV charging.' This not only provides drivers with more accessible and affordable charging options but also allows charger owners to monetize their investments. Our platform incorporates blockchain to ensure secure transactions, transparent pricing, and a unique rewards system. This setup incentivizes users to participate actively in our ecosystem, contributing to its growth and reliability.

__Relation to / Integration into the Mintbase / NEAR Ecosystem:__
Mapz integrates with the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem by utilizing NFTs to redefine user engagement and ownership. These NFTs represent not just rewards but also virtual land parcels within the Mapz platform. Owners of these parcels can earn advertising revenue, democratizing the way the app operates and its revenue is distributed. By minting these NFTs on the NEAR protocol, we leverage its scalability and cost-effectiveness, while aligning with Mintbase’s vision of a creator-centric economy. This innovative approach not only incentivizes user participation but also contributes to the broader goal of a more equitable and decentralized digital economy.

**Why Your Team is Interested in Creating This Project:**
Our team is driven by the vision of creating a more equitable and participatory digital ecosystem. We believe that Mapz has the potential to disrupt the status quo of community extractive platforms by providing a fair and rewarding system. Our passion lies in leveraging blockchain technology to solve real-world problems, promoting sustainable transportation, and building a community-driven platform where every participant is recognized and rewarded. The opportunity to create a platform that not only serves a practical purpose but also upholds the values of decentralization, fairness, and community empowerment is at the heart of our commitment to this project. We know people need what Mapz offers because the growth of the EV market is undeniable, and we have seen firsthand user frustrations on various user forums and EV publications with the unrealiable state of charging infrastructure. None of the existing solutions have adequately addressed this problem. Mapz combines my passion for bringing web2 users into web3 and addresses a real pain point for a growing user base.


### Project Details

**Mockups/Designs of any UI Components:**
Our MVP already showcases a functional and user-friendly interface, which can be viewed at http://app.mapz.live/. Additionally, we have Figma design files for all UI elements, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user experience across our platform. We can provide the figma files as we advance through the application process. 

**Data Models / API Specifications of the Core Functionality:**
Our database, built on Postgres, comprehensively covers EV chargers across North America. Users can check-in to chargers and leave reviews. We can provide the full database structure and back-end API design, which facilitates these interactions efficiently.

**Overview of the Technology Stack to be Used:**
Mapz is developed using React (Next.js) for the web interface and React Native for mobile. The back-end technology is based on Postgres. 

**Documentation of Core Components, Protocols, Architecture, etc. to be Deployed:**
We have developed an NFT map navigator on web2 technologies, accessible at https://mapz.vercel.app/, and a decentralized one at https://onzmk-taaaa-aaaal-acw4a-cai.icp0.io/. Our architecture is designed to ensure seamless integration of blockchain technology and NFTs into our platform.

**PoC/MVP or Other Relevant Prior Work or Research on the Topic:**
Our MVP, available at http://app.mapz.live/, serves as a testament to our capabilities and vision. It demonstrates our commitment to providing a comprehensive solution for EV owners and incorporates features like charger check-ins and reviews.

**What Your Project is Not or Will Not Provide or Implement:**
Mapz is dedicated to creating a decentralized platform primarily for EV charging infrastructure. While our initial focus has been on this area, we are also expanding our scope to include crowd-sourced gas price information and traffic incident reporting. These additional features are on track to be completed by the end of this month. However, it is important to note that our platform is not aimed at conventional fuel vehicle services beyond gas price monitoring. Our primary dedication remains towards EV technologies and services, aligning with our vision of promoting sustainable and innovative transport solutions.



### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and How Does Your Project Fit into the Ecosystem?**
Mapz integrates seamlessly into the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem by utilizing blockchain technology to decentralize and democratize information sharing related to EV charging stations. Additionally, we allow our users to list their home chargers to guests who can reserve these chargers on our platform.  The goal is to build a DePIN network for electric vehicle charging. Our project introduces a unique model where users are rewarded for their contributions through NFTs, fostering a more inclusive and participative community.

**Who is Your Target Audience?**
Our primary target audience includes environmentally conscious consumers, specifically EV owners and enthusiasts. We also cater to those power users who generate a lot of excess power (through solar or other means) and want to sell their power to EV owners for more than what their local utility would pay them. We are also targeting blockchain and crypto enthusiasts who see the value in decentralized applications and NFTs.

**What Need(s) Does Your Project Meet?**
Mapz addresses the lack of reliable, up-to-date information on EV charging infrastructure. Current market solutions are often extractive, offering little to no tangible benefits to users who contribute valuable information or who allow other users to share their EV chargers. Mapz changes this dynamic by rewarding contributors and giving them a stake in the platform.

**Are There Any Other Projects Similar to Yours in the Mintbase / NEAR Ecosystem?**
While there might be projects addressing individual aspects like EV charger reviews or NFT integrations, Mapz stands out by combining these elements in a unique way. We are not aware of any other project in the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem that blends EV charging information, charger sharing, and NFT rewards into one cohesive platform.

**If Not, Are There Similar Projects in Related Ecosystems?**
In broader ecosystems, there are platforms like PlugShare for EV charging information, & EVMatch for sharing EV chargers. However, Mapz differentiates itself by being decentralized and offering tangible rewards and ownership to its community through NFTs, setting a new standard in community engagement and benefit.
